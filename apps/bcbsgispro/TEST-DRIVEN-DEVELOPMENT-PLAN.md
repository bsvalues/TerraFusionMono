# BentonGeoPro Test-Driven Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our test-driven development approach for the BentonGeoPro application, focusing on implementing features with tests first to ensure reliability and correctness.

## TDD Process

1. **Write a Test**: Define the expected behavior in a test before writing any implementation code
2. **Run the Test**: Verify it fails (since the functionality hasn't been implemented yet)
3. **Implement the Feature**: Write the minimum code needed to pass the test
4. **Run the Test Again**: Verify the test passes
5. **Refactor Code**: Clean up the implementation while ensuring tests continue to pass
6. **Repeat**: Continue the cycle for additional features and edge cases

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Stability

1. **Health Check System**
   - âœ… Health endpoint with database connection status
   - âœ… Basic API verification test script
   - Error handling for database disconnections

2. **Database Connection Resilience**
   - Connection retry mechanism
   - Graceful degradation during database outages
   - Fallback to in-memory storage when necessary

3. **Core API Tests**
   - Document management API endpoints
   - Parcel data retrieval
   - Workflow state management

### Phase 2: Feature Implementation

4. **Document Classification Enhancement**
   - Improve classification accuracy
   - Add support for additional document types
   - Implement confidence threshold adjustments

5. **Map Visualization Tools**
   - Layer control with opacity and z-index
   - Drawing tools with export options
   - Measurement system with unit conversion

6. **Workflow Management**
   - Customizable checklist items
   - Timeline visualization
   - Status transition tracking

7. **Reporting System**
   - Report template management
   - Scheduled report generation
   - Export in multiple formats

### Phase 3: Integration and UI

8. **Frontend-Backend Integration**
   - API data binding to UI components
   - Form validation aligned with API requirements
   - Error state handling in UI

9. **User Experience**
   - Responsive design
   - Accessibility compliance
   - Performance optimization

## Current Test Status

| Component | Test Status | Coverage | Next Steps |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Health Check API | âœ… Passing | High | Add error scenarios |
| Document Classification | âœ… Passing | Medium | Add more document types |
| Document-Parcel Link | âœ… Passing | Medium | Test bidirectional lookups |
| Drawing Annotation | âœ… Passing | High | Add GeoJSON import/export |
| Map Layer Control | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Low | Create comprehensive tests |
| Workflow Management | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Low | Test state transitions |
| User Authentication | ðŸ”´ Missing | None | Implement basic auth tests |

## Required Test Cases

### Document Classification

- [x] Classify plat map documents correctly
- [x] Classify deed documents correctly
- [x] Classify boundary line adjustment documents
- [x] Handle ambiguous document text
- [x] Reject empty or invalid input
- [ ] Test classification confidence thresholds
- [ ] Test with real-world document samples

### Map Tools

- [x] Create and retrieve annotations
- [x] Add attribution to features
- [x] Export annotations as GeoJSON
- [ ] Test measurement calculations
- [ ] Verify snap-to-feature functionality
- [ ] Test undo/redo operations
- [ ] Verify layer opacity changes

### Document-Parcel Integration

- [x] Link documents to parcels
- [x] Get documents for a parcel
- [x] Get parcels for a document
- [ ] Test document version history
- [ ] Test document classification update events
- [ ] Test parcel search functionality

## Implementation Approach

1. **Start Small**: Begin with essential endpoints and functionality
2. **Build Incrementally**: Add features one by one with tests
3. **Prioritize Stability**: Focus on error handling and edge cases
4. **User-Centered**: Implement features based on user workflows
5. **Continuous Testing**: Maintain and run tests throughout development

## Next Steps

1. Implement database connection resilience
2. Create more detailed test coverage for map tools
3. Expand document classification tests with real examples
4. Develop workflow state management tests
5. Begin implementing reporting system tests
