# 📬 MCP AI Agent: Appeals Routing & Escalation

This notebook defines the Benton County AI Agent logic for triaging, routing, and escalating property value appeals.

---

## 🎯 Agent Purpose
- Ingest appeal records
- Enrich with parcel + assessment context
- Classify type and complexity
- Route to appropriate division or flag for manual review

---

## 🗃️ Appeal Record Schema (from PACS or Forms System)
```yaml
- appeal_id: string
- parcel_id: string
- reason_code: enum [Overvaluation, Classification Error, Exemption Denied, Other]
- filing_date: date
- documents_uploaded: bool
- prior_appeals: int
- requested_value: number
```

---

## 🔍 SQL Mapping Tools

### Tool: `get_parcel_details`
```sql
SELECT parcel_id, situs_address, total_assessed, land_value, building_value, city
FROM Assessments WHERE parcel_id = ? AND year = CURRENT_YEAR;
```

### Tool: `lookup_appeal_history`
```sql
SELECT appeal_id, decision_date, resolution_type FROM Appeals
WHERE parcel_id = ? ORDER BY decision_date DESC;
```

---

## 🔁 Decision Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Appeal Submitted] --> B{Reason Code}
    B -->|Overvaluation| OV[Route to Appraisal Division]
    B -->|Exemption Denied| EX[Route to Exemptions Officer]
    B -->|Classification Error| CL[Route to Mapping or Land Use]
    B -->|Other| HR[Hold for Manual Review]

    OV --> D{Requested Value Change}
    D -->|>25%| M[Flag for Board of Equalization Review]
    D -->|<25%| N[Appraiser Case Assignment]
```

## 🧠 LLM Prompt Template
```txt
A taxpayer has submitted an appeal on parcel 113456000012000 for Overvaluation. They request a reduction from $625,000 to $410,000.

Please:
1. Retrieve current assessed value.
2. Classify appeal type.
3. Determine if value delta > 25%.
4. Suggest routing.

Output:
- Routing decision (division name)
- Escalation required? (true/false)
- Explanation
```

---

## ✅ Example LLM Response
```json
{
  "division": "Appraisal Division",
  "escalation_required": true,
  "explanation": "Requested reduction exceeds 25% of current assessed value; escalate to Board of Equalization per policy."
}
```

---

## 🔐 Safeguards
- Require `parcel_id` verification before routing
- Redact PII from logs
- Log all LLM-generated decisions + human override

---

## 📌 Outputs
- Update to `AppealsRoutingLog`
- Optional integration to task assignment queue
- Slack/email alert to division chief
