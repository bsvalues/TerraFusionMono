Below is a detailed plan to extend your system by adding additional agents for detailed analytics and advanced alerting mechanisms. This will complement your existing Data Quality and Verification Agents by providing deeper insights into system performance and more proactive notifications.

---

## **Overview of New Agents**

1. **Detailed Analytics Agent:**  
   - **Purpose:**  
     Collects, aggregates, and visualizes detailed performance metrics and historical trends from various ETL components. It will allow users to drill down into quality data and observe trends over time.
   - **Key Features:**  
     - Aggregation of detailed logs and metrics (e.g., success rates, processing times, anomaly frequencies).
     - Interactive charts and visualizations (e.g., time-series plots, bar charts for rule impact).
     - Predictive analytics: leveraging historical data to forecast potential issues.
   - **Integration:**  
     - The agent will query data from the same tables and logs used by your Data Quality and Verification agents.
     - It can expose additional API endpoints (e.g., `/api/reports/analytics`) to deliver data for the frontend dashboard.
     
2. **Advanced Alerting Agent:**  
   - **Purpose:**  
     Enhances the current notification system by introducing more granular alerting based on multiple criteria and supporting additional channels.
   - **Key Features:**  
     - Customizable thresholds for triggering alerts (e.g., when a particular quality metric exceeds a set limit).
     - Integration with multiple channels (in addition to email and in-app notifications, consider SMS via APIs like Twilio or even push notifications if your environment supports it).
     - Escalation logic: If an alert remains unacknowledged, the system can escalate the notification.
   - **Integration:**  
     - Extend the current alerting framework. Add configuration options (via a settings UI or configuration file) to set thresholds and preferred channels.
     - Enhance the backend alert dispatch mechanism so that it can send notifications via multiple providers.

## **Step-by-Step Implementation**

### **1. Detailed Analytics Agent**

#### **Backend Enhancements:**

**a. Create a New Endpoint for Analytics:**

Add a new endpoint, for example in your Flask app, to serve detailed analytics data.  
*File: `report_api.py` (or similar)*

```python
@app.route('/api/reports/analytics')
def analytics_report():
    # Dummy data: Replace this with actual aggregation logic from your ETL logs
    analytics_data = {
        "total_issues": 150,
        "avg_processing_time": 120,  # in seconds
        "issues_over_time": [
            {"date": "2025-03-01", "issues": 5},
            {"date": "2025-03-02", "issues": 8},
            {"date": "2025-03-03", "issues": 10},
            # More data...
        ],
        "rule_impact": [
            {"rule": "Missing Owner", "occurrences": 35},
            {"rule": "Geometry Error", "occurrences": 20},
            # More data...
        ]
    }
    return jsonify(analytics_data)
```

**b. Logging and Data Aggregation for Analytics:**  
Implement a logging mechanism that saves detailed performance metrics to your database or file system. Over time, these logs will be aggregated (using Pandas or SQL queries) to produce the analytics reports.  
*You might create a module `analytics.py` that runs periodically (or is triggered by the CI/CD pipeline) to aggregate log data into a report format.*

#### **Frontend Integration:**

**a. Create a React Component for Analytics Dashboard:**

*File: `QualityAnalytics.tsx`*

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Container, Typography, Paper } from '@mui/material';
import { LineChart, Line, XAxis, YAxis, Tooltip, CartesianGrid, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts';
import axios from 'axios';

interface TrendData {
  date: string;
  issues: number;
}

const QualityAnalytics: React.FC = () => {
  const [trendData, setTrendData] = useState<TrendData[]>([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('/api/reports/analytics')
      .then(response => {
        setTrendData(response.data.issues_over_time);
      })
      .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching analytics data:', error));
  }, []);

  return (
    <Container>
      <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>Detailed Analytics</Typography>
      <Paper style={{ padding: 16, marginTop: 16 }}>
        <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
          <LineChart data={trendData}>
            <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
            <XAxis dataKey="date" />
            <YAxis />
            <Tooltip />
            <Line type="monotone" dataKey="issues" stroke="#8884d8" activeDot={{ r: 8 }} />
          </LineChart>
        </ResponsiveContainer>
      </Paper>
    </Container>
  );
};

export default QualityAnalytics;
```

**b. Integrate the component into your existing dashboard.**

### **2. Advanced Alerting Agent**

#### **Backend Enhancements:**

**a. Extend Alerting Logic:**

Enhance the existing notification functions to support additional channels and thresholds.

*File: `alerts.py` (new or extended module)*

```python
import smtplib
from email.message import EmailMessage
import os
# If you plan to integrate SMS, you might use a package like twilio

def send_email_alert(subject, body):
    msg = EmailMessage()
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg['From'] = os.getenv('EMAIL_FROM')
    msg['To'] = os.getenv('ALERT_RECIPIENTS')
    msg.set_content(body)
    try:
        with smtplib.SMTP(os.getenv('EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER'), int(os.getenv('EMAIL_SMTP_PORT', '587'))) as server:
            server.starttls()
            server.login(os.getenv('EMAIL_USERNAME'), os.getenv('EMAIL_PASSWORD'))
            server.send_message(msg)
        print("Email alert sent.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Failed to send email alert:", e)

# Placeholder for SMS or push notification logic
def send_sms_alert(message):
    # Implement SMS alert logic using a service like Twilio
    print("SMS alert sent (stub):", message)

def notify_alert(alert_type, message):
    # This function decides which channels to use based on alert_type or configuration
    send_email_alert(f"[Alert] {alert_type}", message)
    # Optionally, send SMS or in-app notifications
    send_sms_alert(message)
```

**b. Integrate Customizable Alerts:**
- Allow administrators to define thresholds in a configuration file or via a UI. Based on those thresholds, if an issue crosses the limit, trigger the advanced notifications.
  
#### **Frontend Integration:**

**a. Display In-App Alerts:**

Use a notification system in your React app like `notistack` to show real-time in-app alerts.

```tsx
// Install notistack: npm install notistack

import React from 'react';
import { SnackbarProvider, useSnackbar } from 'notistack';

const AlertComponent = () => {
  const { enqueueSnackbar } = useSnackbar();

  // Example: Trigger an alert based on a condition or fetched notification
  const triggerAlert = () => {
    enqueueSnackbar('High severity issue detected!', { variant: 'error' });
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={triggerAlert}>Test In-App Alert</button>
  );
};

const App = () => (
  <SnackbarProvider maxSnack={3}>
    <AlertComponent />
    {/* Other components */}
  </SnackbarProvider>
);

export default App;
```

**b. Dashboard Integration:**
- Embed controls to view historical alerts and their statuses.
