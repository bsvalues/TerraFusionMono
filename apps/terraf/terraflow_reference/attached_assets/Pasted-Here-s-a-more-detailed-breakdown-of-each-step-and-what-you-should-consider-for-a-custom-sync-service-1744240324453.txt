Here's a more detailed breakdown of each step and what you should consider for a custom sync service based on your outlined next steps:

## Detailed Design and Architectural Document

1. **Define Data Flow and Modules:**
   - **Data Flow:**  
     - **Source:** Production tables are cloned to a training/staging database.  
     - **Extraction:** Capture changes from cloned tables using triggers, change data capture (CDC), or timestamp comparisons.  
     - **Transformation:** Minimal transformation of data (e.g., normalization, applying default values, mapping fields) based on your configuration files.  
     - **Loading:** Push the transformed records into the central API Gateway (or directly into the training environment) via secure endpoints.
   - **Modules:**  
     - **Extraction Module:** Captures changes from cloned tables.  
     - **Transformation Module:** Applies business rules and maps source data to the target schema.  
     - **Load Module:** Pushes data upstream into the training environment or central API.
     - **Error Handling Module:** Monitors process integrity, logs errors, and manages rollbacks.
     - **Monitoring & Reporting Module:** Tracks performance, data discrepancies, and provides audit logs.

2. **Error Handling & Recovery:**
   - Define error conditions (e.g., data mismatch, network interruption, timestamp conflicts).
   - Implement logging and alerting for any sync errors.
   - Plan for rollback mechanisms in case of critical errors—for instance, automatically revert to the previous data state and flag issues for manual review.

3. **Integration Points:**
   - **Cloned Tables:**  
     Document how cloned tables replicate production data. Specify the mechanism for frequent updates (batch vs. real-time) and how incremental changes are determined.
   - **Central API Gateway:**  
     Define the API endpoints that will receive the transformed data. Ensure these endpoints are secure (using token-based or certificate-based authentication) and capable of handling high throughput.

## Building the Prototype

1. **Clone Production Tables:**
   - Select a subset of key production tables.
   - Automate the cloning process—this can be done with scheduled scripts or a one-time migration tool.
   - Ensure the clone includes all necessary schema details (primary keys, field defaults, lookup configurations).

2. **Implement Basic Sync Logic:**
   - **Capture Changes:**  
     Create a process that runs periodically to detect updates in the cloned tables. This might involve:
     - Reading change logs or comparing timestamps.
   - **Apply Minimal Transformation:**  
     Use your mapping configuration (i.e., from DataChangeMaps.sql, FieldDefaultValues.sql) to perform necessary field adjustments without major business logic alterations.
   - **Push Updates to Training Environment:**  
     Develop a simple API client within your service to push updated data to your central API endpoint.
   - **Automation:**  
     Schedule these tasks with cron jobs, Celery, or another task scheduler.

## Testing Extensively

1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Create tests for each module (extraction, transformation, loading).
   - Validate that change detection logic correctly captures only the differences since the last sync.
   - Test transformation routines with various data scenarios (including edge cases).

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Simulate an end-to-end sync—from change capture in cloned tables through to data arrival at the API.
   - Validate data accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
   - Include tests for error handling (e.g., forced failure scenarios) to check rollback and logging behavior.

3. **Performance and Conflict Testing:**
   - Load testing for high volumes of changes.
   - Test scenarios where concurrent updates may occur to see how conflicts are resolved or flagged.

## Iterate & Expand

1. **Scale Up:**
   - Once the prototype successfully syncs a limited set of tables, include additional tables gradually.
   - Expand transformation rules to include more complex mappings or concatenations as required.
   - Monitor performance regularly and adjust processing intervals or resource allocations.

2. **Feedback Loop:**
   - Build mechanisms to report data inconsistencies or sync delays.
   - Gather logs and user feedback to continuously refine the transformation and conflict resolution rules.

## Finalize & Document

1. **Production Roll-out Preparation:**
   - Finalize all modules and integrate thorough end-to-end testing in your staging/production-like environment.
   - Ensure that monitoring, logging, and alert systems are fully operational.
   - Develop a fallback/rollback plan that can be triggered automatically if errors occur post-deployment.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Compile detailed documentation covering:
     - Architecture and design of the sync service.
     - Setup and operational guides, including configuration details for cloned tables and API endpoints.
     - Error handling, rollback procedures, and troubleshooting guidelines.
     - Test cases and performance benchmarks for future reference.

3. **Maintenance Plan:**
   - Schedule regular reviews of the sync service.
   - Plan for incremental improvements and incorporate automated testing results into performance monitoring dashboards.

By following this comprehensive plan, you'll build a custom sync service that isolates heavy ETL work from your main production system, leverages cloned tables for safe testing, and provides robust, automated data synchronization to your central API Gateway. This will allow you to confidently support third-party applications with up-to-date, normalized data without impacting your live environment.
