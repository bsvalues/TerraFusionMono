## Overview

The project will be executed in three major phases:

1. **Phase 1 – Planning, Code Analysis, and Preliminary Testing:**  
   Establish the groundwork by reviewing the codebase, identifying dependencies and potential issues, setting up the development environment, and designing the testing strategy. All planned changes and test cases will be validated in this phase before proceeding.

2. **Phase 2 – Incremental Implementation & Unit/Integration Testing:**  
   Implement changes (bug fixes, feature enhancements, refactoring) on a module-by-module basis. Each change is accompanied by targeted unit tests and integration tests. Every step is only finalized when tests pass successfully, ensuring that regressions are caught early.

3. **Phase 3 – End-to-End Functional Testing & Final Code Review:**  
   Conduct comprehensive end-to-end functional testing covering real-world usage and user workflows on a staging environment. After all testing is complete, a detailed progress report is generated. This phase concludes with a full review of the entire codebase to ensure quality, consistency, security, and maintainability.

Each phase includes a progress checkpoint and a "go/no-go" decision point to ensure that all tests are cleared before moving on.

     Document the flow between the frontend, backend, and any middleware components to identify critical integration points.

3. **Designing the Testing Strategy:**
   - **Test Suite Definition:**  
     Define a suite of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Create or update existing test cases to cover core functionalities.
   - **Tooling Setup:**  
     Configure the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automatically run tests upon code changes.
   - **Risk Assessment:**  
     Identify high-risk areas (e.g., security modules, authentication, data processing) and plan for additional targeted tests.
   
4. **Preliminary Testing:**
   - **Run Initial Tests:**  
     Execute existing unit and integration tests to confirm baseline functionality.
   - **Documentation of Findings:**  
     Record any failures or issues, and create a list of modifications or further tests required prior to implementation.
   - **Checkpoint Review:**  
     Validate that all foundational tests pass before transitioning to Phase 2.

*Once Phase 1 is complete and all preliminary testing is cleared, a progress report will be generated summarizing the current state of the code, testing coverage, and identified areas of concern.*

### Phase 2: Incremental Implementation & Unit/Integration Testing

**Objectives:**
- Methodically implement code changes and enhancements on a per-module basis.
- Run detailed tests after each implementation step to ensure no regressions.
- Maintain a clear audit trail and documentation for every change.

**Steps:**

1. **Branching and Version Control Setup:**
   - **New Feature Branches:**  
     Create separate branches for individual modules or fixes. This allows for isolated development and testing.
   - **Commit and Documentation:**  
     Ensure that each commit is well-documented with details on what has changed and why.

2. **Module-by-Module Implementation:**
   - **Update One Module at a Time:**  
     Make code changes on a module-by-module basis. For each module:
     - **Code Refactoring/Enhancement:** Implement changes as planned.
     - **Local Unit Testing:**  
       Run all relevant unit tests immediately after changes to ensure no local breakage.
     - **Integration Testing:**  
       After updating a module, run integration tests to verify proper interactions with other parts of the system.
     - **Manual QA:**  
       Perform manual checks, especially for complex functionalities or UI components, if necessary.

3. **Automated Testing and CI Integration:**
   - **Continuous Integration (CI):**  
     Once a module passes local tests, merge changes into the development branch and trigger CI to run the full suite of tests.
   - **Regression Testing:**  
     Re-run existing tests to ensure that new changes have not affected previously working functionalities.
   - **Issue Resolution:**  
     If tests fail at any step, address the errors immediately before progressing further.

4. **Interim Progress Reporting:**
   - **Detailed Documentation:**  
     Update logs with summaries of changes, test results, and any encountered issues along with their resolutions.
   - **Checkpoint Decision:**  
     Confirm that all tests pass for the current module before merging and moving on to the next. A consolidated progress report highlighting completed modules, testing outcomes, and pending issues is generated at the end of Phase 2.

*By the end of Phase 2, the project should reflect incremental improvements with full unit and integration test coverage for each module. The progress report at this stage will serve as the benchmark for overall system health heading into end-to-end testing.*
