Here’s a detailed plan on how to deploy your property export functionality and its accompanying verification system, taking into account your environment and security considerations:

---

### 1. Packaging and Containerization

- **Containerize the Application:**  
  Package your entire sync service—including the PropertyExportEngine, verification modules, and API endpoints—into a Docker container. This ensures that the application runs with a consistent environment regardless of where it’s deployed.
  - **Dockerfile:**  
    Create a Dockerfile that installs all dependencies (such as Python, pyodbc, required ODBC drivers, and other libraries) and sets up the environment. Ensure that it reads environment variables (like `SQL_SERVER_CONNECTION_STRING`) at runtime.

- **Environment Variables:**  
  Configure your container to use environment variables for production versus training. This is crucial for the SQL Server connection string, Windows Authentication settings, and any other configurable parameters.

---

### 2. Continuous Integration and Testing

- **CI/CD Pipeline:**  
  Integrate a CI/CD pipeline (using tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins) to automatically:
  - Build your Docker image.
  - Run unit and integration tests (including the comprehensive verification tests).
  - Push the image to a container registry.

- **Automated Testing:**  
  Ensure the pipeline runs pre-deployment tests (connectivity tests, stored procedure execution tests, endpoint tests) and post-deployment tests to validate that everything functions as expected.

### 3. Deployment Options

- **On-Premises Deployment:**  
  Since your environment uses Windows Authentication and is on the Benton County network, the safest and most secure option is to deploy your Dockerized application on an on-premises server that can access your SQL Server.
  - Use a container orchestration platform such as Docker Compose (for simple setups) or Kubernetes (for a more scalable, production-grade setup) within your internal network.
  - Verify that the production server has the required ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server installed.

- **Staging and Production Separation:**  
  - **Staging Environment:**  
    Deploy first to a staging environment that mirrors production. This lets you perform final round integration testing and user acceptance testing without risk.
  - **Production Environment:**  
    Once staging tests pass, roll out to production. Use rolling deployments or blue-green deployment strategies to ensure seamless transitions and easy rollbacks if issues arise.

- **API Gateway Integration:**  
  Ensure that once deployed, your property export module’s outputs are exposed through your central API Gateway. This can be done by updating the gateway’s configuration to include endpoints that connect to your newly deployed service.

### 4. Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting

- **Centralized Logging:**  
  Integrate your application logs with a centralized logging solution (like ELK, Splunk, or Sentry). This provides real-time monitoring and error tracking.
- **Health Checks:**  
  Use built-in health checks and readiness probes (if using Kubernetes) to monitor the status of your containers.
- **Alerting:**  
  Set up alerts for critical errors (e.g., failed stored procedure execution, connectivity issues) so that the development team is notified immediately if something goes wrong.

### 5. Rollout and Documentation

- **Documentation:**  
  Update your deployment documentation to include:
  - How to set the required environment variables.
  - Steps for updating the SQL connection string.
  - Guidelines for scaling the service and troubleshooting common issues.
- **User Training:**  
  Train the IT/operations team on how to monitor the new service, read logs, and trigger rollbacks if needed.
- **Feedback and Iteration:**  
  Monitor the first few deployments closely, gather feedback, and iterate on your deployment process and configuration if any issues are identified.

### 6. Final Checklist Before Production Deployment

1. Confirm the Docker image builds without errors.
2. Run your full suite of automated tests in the CI/CD pipeline.
3. Deploy to a staging environment and verify connectivity to SQL Server using Windows Authentication.
4. Validate that the ExportPropertyAccess stored procedure executes correctly and job tracking in your SyncJob and SyncLog tables is accurate.
5. Verify that the API endpoints for property export are secure, accessible, and enforce role-based access.
6. Ensure that logs and performance metrics are being collected and monitored.

By following these steps, your property export module—with its verification system—will be reliably deployed in a controlled, secure manner. This approach provides isolation (through containerization), consistency (via CI/CD), and visibility (through logging and monitoring), ensuring that production systems remain stable while your new functionality is brought online.
