Data Stability and Security Framework for Benton County Washington Assessor's Office
Based on my research into best practices for property tax data management and security systems, I'll outline a comprehensive framework for creating the most data-stable and secure system possible for the Benton County Washington Assessor's Office, with particular focus on data conversion processes.
1. Data Governance Foundation
Strategic Data Classification System
First, implement a rigorous data classification framework that categorizes all property assessment data based on sensitivity levels:

Level 1 (Public): General property information already in the public domain
Level 2 (Internal): Administrative data requiring basic protection
Level 3 (Confidential): Personal taxpayer information requiring enhanced security
Level 4 (Restricted): Highly sensitive information requiring maximum protection

This classification system forms the foundation for applying appropriate security controls based on data sensitivity, which is essential for government records management. Revolutiondatasystems
Data Sovereignty Compliance
Create a comprehensive data sovereignty and compliance framework that defines:

Geographic restrictions for data storage (ensuring all data remains within U.S. territory)
Compliance requirements mapping to Washington state laws
Regular audit procedures to verify continued compliance

2. Secure Data Conversion Architecture
Phased Conversion Approach
Implement a phased data conversion strategy rather than attempting a "big bang" approach:
