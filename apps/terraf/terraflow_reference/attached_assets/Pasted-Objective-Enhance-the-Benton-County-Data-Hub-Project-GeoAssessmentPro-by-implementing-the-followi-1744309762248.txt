Objective:
Enhance the Benton County Data Hub Project (GeoAssessmentPro) by implementing the following prioritized improvements to expand data synchronization, reporting, GIS visualization, CI/CD automation, and mobile responsivenessâ€”all while ensuring robust testing, logging, and version control.

Prioritized Enhancements:

1. Enhanced Data Synchronization Pipeline:

Design and implement a scheduled, incremental data synchronization process between the production database (web_internet_benton) and the training database (pacs_training) using Windows Authentication.

Implement conflict resolution (e.g., timestamp comparison or last-write-wins strategies) and data sanitization for sensitive information before synchronizing to the training environment.

Ensure comprehensive logging and automated notification/alerting on synchronization events.

2. Advanced GIS Visualization Layer:

Integrate an interactive mapping library (such as OpenLayers or extended Leaflet.js) to render property boundaries with dynamic attribute display and temporal visualization.

Develop Flask API endpoints to serve spatial data in GeoJSON (or similar) format from the PostgreSQL GIS database.

Enable export functionality for map data in formats like GeoJSON, Shapefile, and KML.

3. Enhanced Reporting Infrastructure:

Create new Flask API endpoints to generate parameterized, advanced property reports (e.g., trend analysis, value distribution, comparison reports).

Develop corresponding frontend components (using Bootstrap/jQuery) with integrated charting libraries (Chart.js or D3.js) for interactive dashboards.

Implement options for both scheduled and on-demand report generation with export options (PDF, Excel, CSV).

4. CI/CD Pipeline Integration:

Establish a robust CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins) that automates builds, runs a comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, performance, end-to-end), and deploys to staging/production environments.

Implement environment-specific configuration management and automated rollback mechanisms if tests fail.

5. Mobile Interface Optimization:

Optimize the existing Bootstrap-based UI for improved responsiveness and usability on mobile devices.

Integrate location-aware features and offline caching mechanisms to facilitate on-field assessments.

Simplify workflows for mobile-specific tasks.

6. Comprehensive Testing and Monitoring:

Expand and refine the automated test suite to cover all new enhancements, including edge cases and failure scenarios.

Integrate centralized logging (using ELK, Sentry, etc.) and establish real-time monitoring dashboards with automated alerts.

7. Documentation and Versioning:

Update and generate comprehensive documentation covering API endpoints, deployment configurations, and usage guidelines.

Ensure all code changes are tracked using Git with semantic versioning, detailed commit messages, and clear release notes.

Instructions:

Implement the enhancements sequentially, running thorough pre-deployment and post-deployment tests after each phase.

Use the existing MCP architecture to coordinate specialized tasks where applicable.

After each phase, report detailed test results and log metrics; if any errors occur, trigger the automated rollback mechanisms and notify the development team.

Ensure that all enhancements maintain or improve security controls (including Windows Authentication and role-based access) and do not disrupt current functionality.

Outcome:
The enhanced system should provide:

A reliable and automated data synchronization pipeline ensuring real-time consistency between production and training databases.

A next-generation GIS visualization interface with dynamic, exportable spatial data and temporal capabilities.

Advanced and interactive reporting tools for insightful property assessment analytics.

A CI/CD pipeline that guarantees smooth, automated deployments with comprehensive testing and rollback capabilities.

A mobile-optimized UI that is responsive, intuitive, and robust for on-site field use.

Detailed, up-to-date documentation and version control for ongoing maintenance and future upgrades.

Action:
Please begin by implementing the Enhanced Data Synchronization Pipeline, followed by the integration of Advanced GIS Visualization and Reporting capabilities, and then proceed with CI/CD and mobile interface enhancements. Report progress and test outcomes after each phase.
