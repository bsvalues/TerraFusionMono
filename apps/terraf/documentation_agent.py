# TerraFusion System Architecture

## System Overview

TerraFusion is a microservices-based platform designed for code analysis and workflow optimization. The system employs a modular architecture with specialized services that communicate through well-defined APIs.

## Architecture Principles

- **Modularity**: Each component is self-contained with a single responsibility
- **Scalability**: Components can scale independently based on load
- **Resilience**: The system continues to function even if some components fail
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging throughout the system
- **Security**: Defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers

## Component Descriptions

### API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests. It handles:
- Request routing to appropriate microservices
- Authentication and rate limiting
- Request/response transformation
- API versioning

### Authentication Service

The Authentication Service manages:
- User authentication (username/password, OAuth, SSO)
- Token generation and validation
- Permission management
- User profile storage

### Repository Service

The Repository Service handles:
- Repository metadata storage
- Integration with source control systems (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Code retrieval and caching
- Change detection

### Analysis Service

The Analysis Service performs:
- Code quality analysis
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance analysis
- Technical debt assessment

### Model Content Protocol Server

The MCP Server facilitates:
- Communication between AI models and services
- Model output standardization
- Request formatting and validation
- Response processing

### Agent Orchestration Service

The Agent Orchestration Service manages:
- AI agent lifecycle
- Task distribution and scheduling
- Agent communication
- Result aggregation

## Component Relationships

- Clients interact with the system through the API Gateway
- The API Gateway routes requests to appropriate microservices
- The Authentication Service validates all authenticated requests
- The Repository Service provides code to the Analysis Service
- The Analysis Service uses the MCP Server to interact with AI models
- The Agent Orchestration Service manages specialized agents that perform specific tasks

## Data Flow

1. Users authenticate through the Authentication Service
2. Authenticated requests flow through the API Gateway
3. Repository metadata and code are retrieved by the Repository Service
4. Analysis requests are processed by the Analysis Service
5. AI processing is facilitated by the MCP Server
6. AI agents perform specialized tasks coordinated by the Agent Orchestration Service
7. Results are aggregated and returned to the user

## Deployment Architecture

The system is deployed using containerization and orchestration:
- All components are packaged as Docker containers
- Kubernetes manages container deployment and scaling
- Horizontal scaling is configured for each component
- Load balancers distribute traffic across component instances
- Database clusters provide redundancy for persistent storage

## Security Considerations

- All communication uses TLS encryption
- Authentication uses industry-standard protocols (OAuth 2.0, OIDC)
- Authorization follows least-privilege principle
- Secrets are managed using a dedicated secrets management service
- Regular security scanning and penetration testing
