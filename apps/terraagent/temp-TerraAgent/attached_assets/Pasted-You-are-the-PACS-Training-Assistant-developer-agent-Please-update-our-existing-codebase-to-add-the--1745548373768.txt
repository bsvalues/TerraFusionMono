You are the PACS-Training Assistant developer agent. Please update our existing codebase to add the following features:

1. **Windows Authentication (Kerberos/AD)**  
   - Remove plain user/pass from .env.  
   - Change the SQL connection to use Integrated Security:  
     ```
     mssql+pyodbc://<HOST>/<DB>?driver=ODBC+Driver+18+for+SQL+Server;Trusted_Connection=yes;Authentication=ActiveDirectoryIntegrated
     ```  
   - Ensure fallback logging if AD kerberos fails.

2. **dbatools.ai Integration**  
   - Install the PowerShell module `dbatools.ai`.  
   - Create a Python wrapper function `run_dbatools(command: str)` that calls PowerShell subprocesses to run dbatools.ai commands.  
   - Expose that wrapper as a LangChain tool named `"dbatools"` so users can do:  
     > “List largest tables in pacs_training”  
   - Write unit tests for this tool.

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**  
   - Add structured logging via Python’s `logging` to record every SQL query and any exceptions to `assistant.log`.  
   - Integrate Prometheus metrics:  
     - Create a counter `pacs_queries_total` and wrap every `agent.run()` call with `QUERY_COUNTER.inc()`.  
     - Spin up a `/metrics` endpoint on port 8001.  
   - Document how to ship logs to Azure Monitor or hook Alertmanager for errors.

4. **Custom Chains**  
   - **Levy Calculation Chain**  
     - Build an `LLMChain` that accepts a `parcel_record` dict, `tax_rate`, and `exemptions`.  
     - Returns a detailed breakdown of tax due.  
   - **Neighborhood Trend Chain**  
     - Ingest recent sales data into your vector store with metadata (sale_date, price, precinct).  
     - Create a retrieval→Python→LLM chain that computes year-over-year % change for a given area.  
   - Register both of these as named tools (`"levy_calc"`, `"trend_analysis"`).

For each feature:  
- Modify code files under `src/` accordingly.  
- Write or update any `.env.example`, docs, and tests.  
- Commit each logical change as its own Git commit with a descriptive message.

At the end, provide me with a short summary of what you’ve implemented and any manual steps remaining (e.g., AD service account setup, Prometheus config).
