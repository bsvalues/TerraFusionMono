You are implementing a revolutionary AI platform for the Benton County Assessor's Office following a precisely defined three-phase development approach. This system employs a multi-agent architecture ("AI Army") to transform property assessment operations while ensuring compliance with Washington State regulations.
SYSTEM OVERVIEW
This platform will:

Validate and enhance property data quality with automated checks
Generate accurate property valuations using AI-powered models
Provide authoritative property tax information through specialized agents
Automate critical workflows for clerical and appraisal staff
Ensure strict compliance with Washington State assessment laws

CURRENT DEVELOPMENT PHASE
You are currently implementing Phase 2 of our strategic development plan:
Phase 1 (COMPLETED):

Comprehensive code audit of existing modules
Refactoring for error handling and UI corrections
Testing framework and CI/CD pipeline implementation
Documentation improvements

Phase 2 (CURRENT FOCUS):

Development of the Data Quality & Compliance Module
Creation of the AI Army prototype with agent framework
Implementation of inter-agent communication protocol
Development of at least two prototype agents (Data Quality and Compliance)

Phase 3 (UPCOMING):

UI/UX redesign and dashboard development
Complete workflow automation integration
Full agent system deployment
End-to-end system testing and optimization

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
The system architecture centers on a Master Control Program (MCP) that orchestrates specialized AI agents:

Master Control Program:

Central orchestration service for task delegation
Inter-agent message routing and monitoring
System-wide logging and state management


AI Army Agents:

Data Quality Agent: Validates property data integrity and flags anomalies
Compliance Agent: Ensures adherence to Washington State regulations
Valuation Agent: Calculates accurate property values using advanced models
User Interaction Agent: Handles staff queries and interface interactions


Core Infrastructure:

Robust data pipelines for property information
Secure database architecture with versioning
Modern API framework for system integration
Comprehensive testing suite for all components



DATA STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS

All property data must conform to Washington State Department of Revenue standards
Validation rules must identify common assessment errors (boundary issues, classification errors)
Tax calculations must follow Benton County's current mill rates and exemption rules
All data operations must maintain strict audit trails for compliance

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES
For the current phase, focus on implementing:

First Priority: Data Quality & Compliance Module with validation rules
Second Priority: AI Agent framework with inter-agent communication protocol
Third Priority: Prototype agents (Data Quality and Compliance)
Fourth Priority: Testing framework for all new components

YOUR TASK
Implement the critical components for Phase 2 with production-quality code that meets all testing, documentation, and performance requirements. Your code will establish the foundation for a system that revolutionizes government assessment operations through applied artificial intelligence.
This main context provides the Replit AI Agent with:

Clear understanding of the three-phase approach
Current phase focus and priorities
Technical architecture details
Specific implementation priorities

The context is structured to give the agent both the big picture and the immediate focus areas, which should guide it to produce code that aligns perfectly with your development roadmap
