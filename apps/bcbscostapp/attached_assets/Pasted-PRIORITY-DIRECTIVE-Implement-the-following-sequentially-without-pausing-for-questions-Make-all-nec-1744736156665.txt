PRIORITY DIRECTIVE: Implement the following sequentially without pausing for questions. Make all necessary decisions autonomously to reach 97%+ completion.

// PHASE 1: RESOLVE SUPABASE CONNECTION ISSUES
- Immediately diagnose Supabase connection errors by examining supabaseClient.ts
- Implement a robust fallback mechanism:
  • Create a local storage-based authentication state manager
  • Implement localStorage-based data persistence for offline functionality
  • Set up a CRON-style retry mechanism for Supabase reconnection attempts
  • Add error boundary components to gracefully handle connection failures
- Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures

// PHASE 2: IMPLEMENT LOCAL-FIRST DATA ARCHITECTURE
- Create local data models that mirror Supabase schema
- Implement IndexedDB storage using Dexie.js for efficient client-side data persistence
- Set up a synchronization mechanism to reconcile local and remote data when connection is restored
- Add timestamps for conflict resolution strategy
- Implement robust change tracking mechanisms

// PHASE 3: COMPLETE CALCULATION ENGINE
- Implement Arkansas-specific property assessment formulas:
  • 20% market value calculation after depreciation
  • Implement lookup tables for Arkansas county millage rates
  • Add formula for penalty calculations (10% of assessed value)
- Build comprehensive validation for all user inputs
- Implement business logic for different property types:
  • Vehicles (with VIN validation)
  • Boats
  • Trailers
  • ATVs
  • RVs
  • Aircraft
  • Livestock
  • Motorcycles
  • Business property
- Add caching for calculation results

// PHASE 4: OPTIMIZE UI/UX
- Implement responsive design optimizations:
  • Add mobile-first layout components
  • Optimize touch targets for mobile
  • Implement progressive form disclosure
- Add real-time validation feedback
- Implement optimistic UI updates
- Add loading states and skeleton screens
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Implement proper focus management and keyboard navigation

// PHASE 5: IMPLEMENT PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT
- Add service worker for offline functionality
- Implement app manifest for installability
- Add background sync for deferred Supabase updates
- Implement push notifications for assessment deadlines
- Add response compression

// PHASE 6: FINALIZE AND OPTIMIZE
- Implement comprehensive error logging
- Add analytics tracking
- Optimize bundle size through code splitting
- Implement performance monitoring
- Add user feedback collection mechanism
- Create basic help documentation
- Set up automated test suite

ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY:
- Always fail gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- If Supabase connection fails, continue with local-only mode
- Log all errors to console with detailed diagnostic information
- Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Implement circuit breaker to prevent repeated failed API calls

COMPLETION VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
- Application loads without critical errors
- Users can enter property data offline
- Calculation engine produces accurate results
- UI is responsive on all device sizes
- Data persists between sessions
- Help documentation is accessible
- Error states are handled gracefully

Do not stop for clarification at any point. When faced with implementation decisions, choose the most robust option that aligns with standard React and modern web development patterns.
