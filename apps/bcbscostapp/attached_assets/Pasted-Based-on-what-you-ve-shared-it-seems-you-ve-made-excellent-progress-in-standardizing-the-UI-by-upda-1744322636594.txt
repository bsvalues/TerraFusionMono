Based on what you've shared, it seems you’ve made excellent progress in standardizing the UI by updating the What-If Scenarios page with the LayoutWrapper and removing the authentication dependencies. That's a significant win for consistent navigation and styling across the application.

Given that the page structure is now functioning as expected—but the actual content isn’t loading due to the missing what_if_scenarios table—I’d recommend prioritizing a fix for the underlying database issue. Here’s why:

- **Data Integrity and Functionality:**  
  The core value of the What-If Scenarios page is to display relevant data. Without the what_if_scenarios table (or its proper definition and population), users will see only the structure without meaningful content. Addressing the database table should be our next critical step so that the page can serve its intended purpose.

- **Consistent UI Already in Place:**  
  Since you've already applied the LayoutWrapper for the What-If Scenarios page—and assuming similar layout wrappers are available and won’t conflict—you can plan to roll it out across other pages. However, without actual data backing, later UI updates might not be fully verifiable in a real-world scenario. Fixing the database now lets you test the UI under real data conditions.

- **Parallel Development Possibility:**  
  If your workflow permits parallel work, you might consider one of the following approaches:
  - **Parallel Tasks:** Work on defining and creating the what_if_scenarios table (and associated API endpoints/data fetching logic) while also updating the LayoutWrapper for the remaining pages. This keeps the momentum on both fronts.
  - **Sequential Approach:** Alternatively, you could finish the database portion first, ensuring that data loads correctly on the What-If Scenarios page. Once verified, update the other pages with the LayoutWrapper component. This sequence minimizes potential integration surprises later on.

Given these points, my recommendation is to **tackle the database issue for the what_if_scenarios table first**. Once that’s resolved and you’re confident that data flows correctly through the system, then extend the LayoutWrapper updates to other pages for a fully consistent UI experience.
