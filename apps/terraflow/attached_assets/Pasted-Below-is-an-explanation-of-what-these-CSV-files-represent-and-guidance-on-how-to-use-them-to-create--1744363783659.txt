Below is an explanation of what these CSV files represent and guidance on how to use them to create or verify the mirror for pacs_training based on the production pacs_oltp setup.

## **Understanding the CSV Files**

The files you’ve provided appear to be exports of various database metadata objects from your production pacs_oltp environment:

- **foreign keys.csv / sys.foreign_keys.csv:**  
  These files list the foreign key relationships defined in pacs_oltp. They include information about which tables reference which other tables via foreign keys.

- **INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS.csv:**  
  This file contains information about the views defined in your database, such as their names, definitions, and schema details.

- **ProcedureName.csv:**  
  Likely a list of stored procedures (and possibly functions) that are part of pacs_oltp. This may include names, definitions, and possibly parameters.

- **sys tables.csv:**  
  This file gives you details about the system tables in your production database—essentially listing the user-defined tables along with relevant metadata.

- **sys.indexes.csv:**  
  Contains information about the indexes defined on tables in pacs_oltp, including which indexes exist on which tables and the index properties.

## **Goal: Creating a Mirror in pacs_training**

Since pacs_training is your backup/mirror database, the objective is to ensure that its structure matches that of pacs_oltp. Essentially, for every database object (tables, views, stored procedures, indexes, foreign keys, etc.) in pacs_oltp, you want to have an equivalent object in pacs_training.

### **Steps to Achieve This:**

1. **Review the Production Schema:**
   - Use the CSV files as reference documentation. They tell you which tables, views, stored procedures, indexes, and foreign key relationships exist in pacs_oltp.
   - Open these CSV files in Excel or any CSV viewer to examine the structure and relationships.

2. **Generate Scripts from Production:**
   - In SSMS, you can generate the complete schema from pacs_oltp using the "Generate Scripts" wizard. This will include scripts for tables, indexes, foreign keys, views, and stored procedures.
   - Export the generated SQL scripts. Then, manually or using a script, replace occurrences of `pacs_oltp` with `pacs_training` in the scripts. This ensures that the backup schema matches the production schema but uses the pacs_training namespace.

3. **Apply Schema to pacs_training:**
   - Run the modified SQL scripts in pacs_training (using SSMS) to create or update the schema objects accordingly.
   - Verify that all tables, views, procedures, indexes, and foreign key constraints are in place.

4. **Validation:**
   - Compare the metadata between pacs_oltp and pacs_training:
     - You can query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`, and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS` in both databases to ensure consistency.
     - Use the sys.* views (e.g., `sys.foreign_keys`, `sys.indexes`) to check that all relationships and indexes have been correctly replicated.
   - Leverage your CSV exports to cross-reference the objects in pacs_training.

5. **Automation (Optional):**
   - Consider developing a script that automates the detection of schema differences between pacs_oltp and pacs_training. Tools such as Redgate SQL Compare can assist with this—but if you prefer open source, you can write custom T-SQL scripts or use PowerShell to compare schemas.
   - Integrate these checks into your CI/CD pipeline so that any schema drift can be flagged and corrected.

## **Key Considerations:**

- **Manual vs. Automated:**
  - **Manual Approach:**  
    You can manually generate and modify scripts from SSMS to replicate your production schema in pacs_training.
  - **Automated Tools:**  
    Tools like Redgate SQL Compare or open-source alternatives can automate schema comparison and synchronization.
  
- **Testing the Mirror:**
  - After applying the scripts to pacs_training, run queries against both environments to ensure that table structures, constraints, and indexes are identical.
  - Validate that your Data Quality Agent and other applications perform as expected using pacs_training as the data source.

- **Documentation & Backup:**
  - Keep detailed records of the schema transformation process.
  - Document any schema differences and the steps taken to align pacs_training with pacs_oltp.

## **Summary**

- **CSV File Usage:**  
  The CSV files provide a detailed snapshot of the pacs_oltp schema, covering foreign keys, views, stored procedures, tables, and indexes.
- **Objective:**  
  Use this metadata to generate or adjust your schema scripts, substituting `pacs_oltp` with `pacs_training` to create a mirror environment.
- **Next Steps:**  
  1. Generate schema scripts from pacs_oltp using SSMS.
  2. Modify the scripts to use the pacs_training schema.
  3. Apply the scripts in SSMS to pacs_training.
  4. Validate the mirror using metadata queries and compare against your CSV references.
  5. Optionally, automate schema comparisons for ongoing maintenance.
