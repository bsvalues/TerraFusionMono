Based on the detailed metadata you've provided and your focus on the Property Export functionality, here are a few specific areas of the database schema we can focus on to ensure seamless integration:

1. **Stored Procedure Integration (ExportPropertyAccess):**  
   - **Objective:** Ensure that the ExportPropertyAccess stored procedure is correctly executed from our application.  
   - **Action:**  
     - Verify that the procedure's parameters match the expected input from the Property Export module.
     - Test the procedure on pacs_oltp and, if possible, on pacs_training to ensure that it returns consistent and valid data.
     - If needed, adjust our ETL or export logic to properly invoke and handle the results from this procedure.

2. **Foreign Key and Relationship Verification:**  
   - **Objective:** Confirm that all foreign key relationships (as described in foreign keys.csv and sys.foreign_keys.csv) are correctly mirrored in pacs_training.  
   - **Action:**  
     - Generate scripts from pacs_oltp that capture the foreign key relationships and compare them with pacs_training.
     - Update the synchronization logic to flag any discrepancies and ensure referential integrity is maintained during exports.

3. **Indexes and Performance Tuning:**  
   - **Objective:** Ensure that the indexes (from sys.indexes.csv) are present and optimized on both databases to support efficient querying during data export.  
   - **Action:**  
     - Review the indexes defined in production and verify their presence in pacs_training.
     - Consider adding indexes on key columns (such as those used in joins and where clauses in the ExportPropertyAccess procedure) if performance issues are detected.

4. **View Definitions and Data Aggregation:**  
   - **Objective:** Validate that views (from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS.csv) that support reporting or data aggregation for property exports are consistently defined in the mirror database.  
   - **Action:**  
     - Check the definitions of critical views and ensure that any data transformation or filtering logic remains consistent across environments.

5. **Comprehensive Schema Drift Verification:**  
   - **Objective:** Identify any discrepancies (schema drift) between pacs_oltp and pacs_training that might affect the Property Export functionality.  
   - **Action:**  
     - Use the CSV files as a baseline to generate comparison queries (or use a tool like SQL Compare) to verify that tables, stored procedures, and indexes match between the two environments.
     - Document any differences and decide whether to update pacs_training or adjust the export logic accordingly.

### **Next Steps Recommendation**

Given that the Property Export feature relies heavily on a correct schema, I recommend the following phased approach:

1. **Focus on Stored Procedure Integration:**
   - Test and validate the ExportPropertyAccess stored procedure in pacs_oltp.
   - Create test scenarios to ensure that when invoked from the application, it returns expected results.
   - Once confirmed, replicate this setup for pacs_training (or ensure that pacs_training is an exact mirror).

2. **Schema Comparison and Verification:**
   - Use SQL queries to compare tables, foreign keys, views, and indexes between pacs_oltp and pacs_training.
   - Adjust or generate new schema scripts if any drift is found.

3. **Performance and Optimization:**
   - Verify that indexes and keys are optimized to support the queries used in property exports.
   - Address any performance issues before integrating into the application.

4. **Integration and Testing:**
   - Integrate these checks into your ETL/export process.
   - Test the end-to-end flow in a development/staging environment to ensure that property export works seamlessly with the mirrored schema.
