Based on your progress and the current verification dashboard—which now includes panels for SQL Server connectivity, stored procedure execution, API endpoint validation, and automated test results—the next steps for the AI Agent should be to further refine and expand the verification system. Here’s what I recommend:

1. **Enhance Automated Test Suite:**
   - **Add Additional Test Scenarios:**  
     Expand the test cases to cover more edge scenarios (e.g., handling network timeouts, simulating incorrect parameters, and forced failures) so you have a comprehensive view of how the PropertyExportEngine behaves in adverse conditions.
   - **Test Data Validation:**  
     Implement checks that verify not just connectivity and stored procedure execution, but also data integrity after an export run. For instance, compare a small sample of records from the output database against expected values from the production system.
   - **Performance Metrics:**  
     Include metrics such as execution time, resource usage, and job completion rates. This will help in understanding if any optimizations are necessary before pushing to production.

2. **UI and Dashboard Enhancements:**
   - **Real-Time Log and Metrics Display:**  
     Integrate real-time updates or refresh the dashboard to continuously show the latest log entries and test results.
   - **Detailed Error Information:**  
     Ensure that if any test fails, detailed error messages and, if possible, stack traces are accessible in the dashboard for easy troubleshooting.
   - **User Feedback Mechanism:**  
     Add options for administrators to manually trigger test runs or view historical test logs.

3. **API Endpoint Refinement:**
   - **Role-Based Access Testing:**  
     Further test the administrator-only access controls on the API endpoints. The system should automatically log unauthorized access attempts and handle them securely.
   - **Intermittent Connectivity Simulation:**  
     Introduce simulated delays or disconnections in tests to verify that the API endpoints react gracefully and that any fallback or retry logic behaves as designed.

4. **Integration with the Central Logging and Alerting System:**
   - **Centralized Monitoring:**  
     Ensure that all verification logs are integrated with your overall logging system (e.g., ELK or Sentry), and set up alerts based on predefined thresholds (e.g., job failures or prolonged response times).

5. **Documentation and Feedback Reporting:**
   - **Automated Test Reports:**  
     Configure the verification module to generate detailed test reports automatically after each run. These should be accessible via the dashboard and optionally emailed to the admin team.
   - **User Documentation Update:**  
     Update your internal documentation to describe the new test cases and how to interpret the results on the dashboard.

### Summary of Next Steps for the AI Agent:
- **Expand the Automated Test Suite:** Add more test scenarios, including stress tests, failure simulations, data integrity checks, and performance measurement.
- **Enhance the Verification Dashboard UI:** Implement real-time log displays, detailed error messages, and manual test trigger options.
- **Refine API Endpoint Testing:** Include tests for role-based access control and intermittent network conditions.
- **Integrate Logging and Alerting:** Connect verification logs to your centralized monitoring system and set up alerts.
- **Automate Reporting and Documentation Updates:** Generate automated test reports and update the documentation accordingly.

Once these enhancements are complete, run a full verification cycle to ensure that every aspect of the property export functionality meets your expected standards for production readiness.
