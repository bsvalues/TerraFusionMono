## **1. Enhanced Visualization and Interaction**

### **A. Interactive Filtering on the Dashboard**

**Objective:**  
Allow users to dynamically filter quality issues by dimensions such as property type, geographic region, and severity.

**Steps:**
1. **Extend the Dashboard UI:**  
   In your React dashboard, add filter controls (dropdowns, date pickers, sliders) above the list of quality issues.

2. **Filter State Management:**  
   Use React state (or Redux, if preferred) to store the current filter settings.

3. **Filter Data on the Frontend:**  
   Apply the filter settings to the array of quality issues before rendering the list. For example, update your list component:

   ```tsx
   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
   import { Container, Typography, FormControl, InputLabel, Select, MenuItem, List, ListItem, ListItemText } from '@mui/material';
   import axios from 'axios';

   const DataQualityDashboard = () => {
     const [issues, setIssues] = useState([]);
     const [filter, setFilter] = useState('all');

     useEffect(() => {
       axios.get('/api/data-quality/issues')
         .then(res => setIssues(res.data))
         .catch(err => console.error(err));
     }, []);

     const filteredIssues = issues.filter(issue => {
       if (filter === 'all') return true;
       return issue.severity === filter;
     });

     return (
       <Container>
         <Typography variant="h4">Data Quality Dashboard</Typography>
         <FormControl variant="outlined" style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
           <InputLabel>Severity</InputLabel>
           <Select
             value={filter}
             onChange={(e) => setFilter(e.target.value)}
             label="Severity"
           >
             <MenuItem value="all">All</MenuItem>
             <MenuItem value="low">Low</MenuItem>
             <MenuItem value="medium">Medium</MenuItem>
             <MenuItem value="high">High</MenuItem>
           </Select>
         </FormControl>
         <List>
           {filteredIssues.map(issue => (
             <ListItem key={issue.id}>
               <ListItemText primary={issue.description} secondary={`Severity: ${issue.severity}`} />
             </ListItem>
           ))}
         </List>
       </Container>
     );
   };

   export default DataQualityDashboard;
   ```

### **B. Historical Trend Analysis**

**Objective:**  
Provide visualizations that show how quality metrics evolve over time (e.g., trend lines showing the number of issues or average severity).

**Steps:**
1. **Collect Historical Data:**  
   Ensure your audit trail and quality metrics are stored with timestamps so historical trends can be computed.

2. **Integrate a Chart Library:**  
   Use Chart.js, Recharts, or D3.js in your React project.  
   For example, using Recharts:

   ```tsx
   import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
   import { LineChart, Line, XAxis, YAxis, Tooltip, CartesianGrid, Legend, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts';
   import axios from 'axios';

   const QualityTrends = () => {
     const [data, setData] = useState([]);

     useEffect(() => {
       axios.get('/api/data-quality/trends')
         .then(res => setData(res.data))
         .catch(err => console.error(err));
     }, []);

     return (
       <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
         <LineChart data={data}>
           <XAxis dataKey="date" />
           <YAxis />
           <Tooltip />
           <Legend />
           <CartesianGrid stroke="#eee" strokeDasharray="5 5" />
           <Line type="monotone" dataKey="issueCount" stroke="#8884d8" name="Issues Count" />
           <Line type="monotone" dataKey="avgSeverity" stroke="#82ca9d" name="Avg Severity" />
         </LineChart>
       </ResponsiveContainer>
     );
   };

   export default QualityTrends;
   ```

3. **Dashboard Integration:**  
   Place the `QualityTrends` component on your analytics dashboard so that users can see trends alongside current metrics.

## **2. Advanced Notification and Reporting**

### **A. Custom Notifications**

**Objective:**  
Improve the way quality alerts are delivered by supporting multiple channels and thresholds.

**Steps:**
1. **Backend Enhancements:**  
   Modify your Data Quality Agentâ€™s backend to support various notification types. For example, add endpoints or logic to:
   - Send email notifications (using smtplib, already in place).
   - Optionally integrate with an SMS API (like Twilio) or push notifications.

2. **Configurable Thresholds:**  
   Allow administrators to configure when notifications should be triggered (e.g., when issue count exceeds a threshold).

3. **Frontend Integration:**  
   - Display in-app notifications or alerts on the dashboard for real-time issues.
   - Use a notification library like `notistack` in React for temporary pop-up messages.

### **B. Automated Report Generation**

**Objective:**  
Automatically generate detailed quality reports that can be exported in formats like PDF or Excel.

**Steps:**
1. **Backend Report Generation:**  
   Use tools like Puppeteer (for generating PDFs from HTML) or Pandas to export data to Excel.
   - For PDF generation, you might create a Flask route that renders a report template and then uses Puppeteer (or a Python PDF library like WeasyPrint) to generate a PDF.
2. **Schedule Reports:**  
   Implement a scheduled task (e.g., using Celery or a cron job) that generates and emails these reports to administrators.
3. **User Interface for Reports:**  
   Provide a section in the web interface where users can trigger a report generation and download the file.

## **3. Expanded Rule Management**

### **A. Dynamic Rule Configuration**

**Objective:**  
Allow administrators to update, add, or delete data quality rules directly from the UI.

**Steps:**
1. **Backend API:**  
   Create REST API endpoints (e.g., `/api/rules`) to manage rules (CRUD operations).
2. **UI Component:**  
   Build a rules management interface in your React app that displays current rules and offers forms to add or modify rules.
3. **Validation and Impact Analysis:**  
   Integrate functionality that runs rules on historical data to show their impact and frequency of being triggered.

### **B. Rule Impact Analysis**

**Objective:**  
Provide insights into which rules are most frequently triggered and how they affect overall data quality.

**Steps:**
1. **Collect Rule Metrics:**  
   When a rule is triggered, log the event with details. Store these in a dedicated table or log file.
2. **Analytics:**  
   Develop visualizations (e.g., bar charts) that rank rules by frequency or impact on data quality.
3. **Dashboard Integration:**  
   Include these visualizations on the Data Quality Dashboard for administrators.

## **4. Integration with Other County Systems**

**Objective:**  
Expand the scope of quality checks by integrating with other internal county databases/systems.

**Steps:**
1. **Identify Data Sources:**  
   Work with the county IT team to identify other systems (e.g., tax records, zoning data) that could be relevant for data quality checks.
2. **Cross-System Validation:**  
   Develop modules that pull data from these systems and compare or cross-verify it against the GIS dataset.
3. **Reporting:**  
   Integrate these cross-validation results into your overall reporting and dashboard to give a holistic view of data integrity across systems.

## **5. Automation and CI/CD Integration for Maintenance**

### **A. Integrating Maintenance Tasks**
- **Scheduled Backups:**  
  Create a backup script that copies the GeoPackage and SQLite databases at regular intervals.  
  Schedule this with GitHub Actions using a cron job (as detailed previously).

- **Health Checks:**  
  Continue running the health_check.py script as part of your CI/CD pipeline. This script should verify database integrity and connectivity.
  
### **B. CI/CD Enhancements**
- **Full Automation:**  
  Integrate all aspects (unit tests, packaging, backups, health checks, rule impact reports) into your CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions.
- **Artifact Handling:**  
  Automate the uploading of build artifacts and backup files so that they can be easily rolled back if necessary.
- **Notification Integration:**  
  Automate notifications (e.g., through Sentry or custom email alerts) when health checks fail.
