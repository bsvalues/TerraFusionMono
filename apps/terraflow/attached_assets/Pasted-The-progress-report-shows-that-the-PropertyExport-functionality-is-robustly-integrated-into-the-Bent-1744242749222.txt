The progress report shows that the PropertyExport functionality is robustly integrated into the Benton County Data Hub. The module covers all key aspects—from the PropertyExportEngine class with SQL Server connectivity and job tracking to the UI, API endpoints, and overall integration with the sync service.

Based on this progress, here are the recommended next steps:

---

### 1. Finalize Production Configuration

- **Set Environment Variables:**  
  Ensure that the `SQL_SERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable is correctly set in your production environment using the proper connection string format. This is critical to enable the module to connect to your actual SQL Server instance.

- **Verify Configuration in sync_service/config.py:**  
  Confirm that all configuration settings (including error handling for missing connection strings) are working as expected before moving to production.

---

### 2. Comprehensive Testing with Actual SQL Server

- **Stored Procedure Execution:**  
  - Test the execution of the ExportPropertyAccess stored procedure against the actual SQL Server database.  
  - Verify that parameterized queries, job tracking, and logging capture all necessary data and errors accurately.
  
- **Test Various Export Scenarios:**  
  - Use different input parameters (e.g., number of years, minimum billing years) to ensure that the export engine correctly adapts to various conditions.
  - Validate data accuracy by comparing exported data with production records.

- **Error Handling:**  
  - Simulate connectivity issues or invalid parameters to ensure that the error handling mechanisms (including job status updates and logging) behave as expected.
  
- **Integration Testing:**  
  - Ensure that the property export job correctly integrates with your SyncJob and SyncLog tables.
  - Confirm that job status transitions (pending, running, completed, and failed) are reported in real time in the UI and through API responses.

### 3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

- **Interface Usability:**  
  - Have real users (or testers) interact with the property export UI.  
  - Confirm that the form is intuitive and that the recent job statuses and error messages are clear and actionable.

- **Role and Permissions Checks:**  
  - Verify that the administrator role (or other defined access controls) is enforced consistently across all endpoints.
  - Test the LDAP bypass in the development/test environment to ensure it works as expected without compromising security.

### 4. Monitoring and Logging Enhancements

- **Centralized Logging:**  
  - Integrate your module’s logs into a centralized logging solution (such as ELK or Sentry). This will make it easier to monitor exports in real time and quickly troubleshoot any issues.
  
- **Performance Metrics:**  
  - Set up dashboards to visualize job durations, success/failure rates, and other key performance indicators for continuous monitoring.

---

### 5. Documentation and Training

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Update your technical documentation to include the PropertyExport module details, configuration steps, and usage instructions.
  - Document the parameter options and provide example scenarios for third-party developers or internal users.
  
- **User Training:**  
  - Prepare training materials (or walkthroughs) to help administrators and other users understand how to trigger exports and interpret job statuses.

---

### 6. Rollout and Feedback

- **Staged Deployment:**  
  - Initially deploy the enhanced functionality to a staging environment that mirrors production.  
  - Once confirmed stable, roll it out to production gradually to minimize risk.
  
- **Feedback Loop:**  
  - Set up a feedback channel for users to report any issues with the export process.  
  - Use this feedback to iterate on and refine the module.

---

### Summary

Your PropertyExport functionality is nearly production-ready. The next phase is focused on ensuring that your SQL Server connectivity, stored procedure execution, and overall job tracking work flawlessly in the production environment. Once thorough testing and configuration finalization are complete, you can confidently roll out the module. By incorporating robust logging, monitoring, and user feedback loops, you’ll enhance both the reliability and maintainability of the system.
