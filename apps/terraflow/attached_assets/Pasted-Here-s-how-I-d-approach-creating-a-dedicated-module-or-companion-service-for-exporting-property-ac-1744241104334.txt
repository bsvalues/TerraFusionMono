Here’s how I’d approach creating a dedicated module (or companion service) for exporting property access data based on the provided stored procedure, and integrating it into your ecosystem without impacting your core operations:

---

### 1. Separate Module Architecture

**a. Isolation:**  
I would design this export functionality as a standalone service—either as a scheduled job or a microservice—that runs independently of your main production processes. This ensures that any issues with the export do not affect your primary database or API gateway.

**b. Service Containerization:**  
Package the export service in its own container (using Docker, for example) so it can be deployed and updated separately. This modular approach allows you to scale and maintain the property access export functionality with minimal risk.

### 2. Workflow and Integration

**a. Scheduled Data Export:**  
- **Trigger Mechanism:**  
  Use a scheduler (such as cron for a Linux environment, Task Scheduler for Windows, or a job scheduler in your container orchestration platform) to periodically run the ExportPropertyAccess procedure.  
- **Execution:**  
  The service would connect to your SQL Server, execute the stored procedure (as documented in your ExportPropertyAccess.docx), and build or update the dedicated web database (e.g., web_internet_benton_auto).

**b. Data Validation and Logging:**  
- **Validation:**  
  After running the stored procedure, the service would validate that the target database has been created/updated successfully. This might involve running basic queries against the new database to check for the expected data.
- **Logging and Alerts:**  
  Integrate logging mechanisms (or even push logs to a centralized system like ELK or Sentry) so that any issues encountered during the export are recorded and alerts are sent if the process fails. The stored procedure already includes logging into a _clientdb_log table; you could extend this by capturing its output in your service logs.

**c. API Gateway Integration:**  
- **Data Exposure:**  
  Once the export database is ready, create endpoints within your central API Gateway to query the exported data. This decouples the internal export process from external consumers.
- **Authentication and Security:**  
  Ensure that the API endpoints exposing the property access data are secured with token-based authentication and proper role-based access controls.

### 3. Implementation Plan

**Step 1: Develop the Export Module**  
- **Build a Script or Application:**  
  Write a script (for example in Python, C#, or any language that works well in your environment) that will:
  - Connect to your SQL Server.
  - Execute the ExportPropertyAccess stored procedure (using a library like pyodbc in Python or ADO.NET in C#).
  - Monitor the returned log messages or status codes to confirm a successful run.
- **Containerization:**  
  Package the script in a Docker container. This container will be responsible solely for running the export process on a schedule.

**Step 2: Configure Scheduling & Monitoring**  
- **Cron Job or Orchestration:**  
  Schedule the container or script to run periodically during off-peak hours (or near real time if required).
- **Log Aggregation:**  
  Integrate with a logging solution to capture the output from the export process, making it easier to troubleshoot if issues arise.

**Step 3: Integrate with API Gateway**  
- **Develop API Endpoints:**  
  Within your central data hub, create RESTful endpoints that query the newly exported property access data.
- **Security and Consistency Checks:**  
  Implement authentication checks for these endpoints, ensuring that only authorized users or systems can retrieve the property access data.
- **Documentation:**  
  Ensure your API documentation includes details on this new data source, how frequently it’s updated, and how third-party systems can access it.

### 4. Testing and Rollout

**Pre-Deployment Testing:**  
- **Unit Testing:**  
  Write tests for the script or application to simulate the execution of the stored procedure.  
- **Integration Testing:**  
  Use a staging or training database to validate that the export process correctly creates the target database with all expected data.
- **Performance and Error Testing:**  
  Simulate scenarios where the export might fail (e.g., network issues or unexpected schema changes) to ensure the rollback and error logging mechanisms work as intended.

**Post-Deployment Monitoring:**  
- **Log Monitoring:**  
  Once deployed, continuously monitor logs for successful exports and performance metrics.
- **User Feedback:**  
  Ensure that external APIs pulling this data report consistency and reliability.

### Summary

By separating the export process into its own dedicated module, you achieve several key benefits:
- **Isolation:** The export process runs independently and doesn’t interfere with your production systems.
- **Flexibility:** You can update, test, and scale the export service without affecting the main data hub.
- **Security and Reliability:** The dedicated module ensures that property access data can be exported, validated, and served through your API gateway safely.

This approach leverages the robustness of your existing ExportPropertyAccess stored procedure while allowing you to manage and iterate on the data export process without risk to your core production database.
