**Replit AI Agent Prompt:**

> **Objective:**  
> Implement the following enhancements to our Benton County Data Hub API Gateway. This system serves as a central hub for managing data from our sinkhole server, our network SQL server, and geospatial sources. It’s intended to provide a secure, scalable, and efficient gateway for third-party applications to move data in and out.
> 
> **Enhancements to be Implemented:**  
> 1. **Enhanced Security & Access Control:**  
>    - Integrate multi-factor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on (SSO) using Azure AD/LDAP.  
>    - Enforce granular, role-based access control with comprehensive audit logging.  
>    - Mandate encryption for data in transit and at rest (FTPS/SFTP).
> 
> 2. **Automation & Intelligent Data Management:**  
>    - Set up automated data workflows (for regular data imports, backups, and syncs between our various data sources).  
>    - Configure trigger-based processing that initiates file conversions, quality checks, and document indexing immediately after data uploads.  
>    - Integrate AI to analyze logs, predict usage peaks, manage bandwidth, and trigger alerts for anomalous activity.
> 
> 3. **Scalability & Performance Optimization:**  
>    - Enable dynamic resource scaling using container orchestration (e.g., Docker with Kubernetes).  
>    - Implement caching and compression strategies to expedite file transfers and reduce storage overhead.  
>    - Incorporate lazy loading and pagination for handling large directories or extensive datasets efficiently.
> 
> 4. **API Integration & Data Federation:**  
>    - Enhance the API gateway to serve as a unified, standardized RESTful interface for all integrated data sources.  
>    - Develop connectors for the sinkhole server, network SQL server, and geospatial datasets, transforming data into consistent, consumable formats (like JSON, GeoJSON).  
>    - Optionally, set up a real-time data streaming service to push updates to connected systems.
> 
> 5. **Monitoring, Logging, and Analytics:**  
>    - Implement centralized logging (e.g., using the ELK stack or Sentry) and monitoring dashboards to track system performance and data flows.  
>    - Set up proactive alerts for system anomalies and errors.  
>    - Create automated tests and simulate high-load conditions to validate performance.
> 
> 6. **Developer & User Empowerment:**  
>    - Produce comprehensive API documentation with interactive examples and a sandbox environment.  
>    - Generate SDKs or code libraries for multiple programming languages to facilitate third-party integrations.  
>    - Enhance user tooling with custom reporting, data visualization, and management portals.
>
> **Testing Requirements:**  
> - **Pre-Implementation Testing:**  
>    - Develop unit and integration tests to validate each enhancement before it’s merged.  
>    - Perform a full test run (including API endpoint tests, security checks, and load testing) on a staging environment.
>  
> - **Post-Implementation Testing:**  
>    - Once enhancements are deployed, run a comprehensive set of end-to-end tests to ensure all functionality is stable and reliable.  
>    - Validate that all integrations—especially authentication, data syncing, and automated workflows—are working as expected.
>    - Log all test results and provide a detailed report on any issues or performance metrics.
>
> **Instructions:**  
> - Implement each enhancement sequentially, ensuring a clean commit after each major change.  
> - Use our existing CI/CD pipelines to automate pre- and post-deployment testing.  
> - If any errors or performance issues are detected, automatically roll back the recent changes and notify the development team with relevant logs.
>
> **Outcome:**  
> This implementation should transform our FTP hub into a powerful, intelligent data gateway that securely manages and disseminates data from diverse sources while providing robust API endpoints for third-party applications.
>
> Please confirm completion of each phase with detailed test reports before moving to the next enhancement phase.
