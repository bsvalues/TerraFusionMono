# AI Agents Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the AI agent ecosystem in the BCBSGeoAssessmentPro platform, including their purpose, functionality, and interaction patterns.

## Overview

The GeoAssessmentPro platform integrates advanced AI agents to provide intelligent data processing, anomaly detection, data validation, and other critical functions. These agents work both independently and collectively to ensure data stability, security, and accuracy.

## AI Agent Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Agent Manager**: Central coordinator for all AI agents, handling registration, communication, and lifecycle management.
2. **Base Agent**: Abstract foundation that all specialized agents inherit from, providing common functionality.
3. **Agent Pool**: Resource management system for scaling agent instances based on workload.
4. **Message Broker**: Communication system allowing inter-agent messaging and coordination.

### Agent Types

#### Anomaly Detection Agent

**Purpose**: Identifies unusual patterns or outliers in property assessment data.

**Key Functions**:
- Monitors property data for statistical anomalies
- Detects sudden changes in property values
- Identifies geographical patterns in anomalies
- Generates alerts for potential data quality issues

**Usage**:
```python
# Example: Request anomaly scan for a specific property
result = framework.request_anomaly_scan(property_id="P12345")
```

#### Data Validation Agent

**Purpose**: Ensures data integrity and adherence to business rules.

**Key Functions**:
- Validates data against schema requirements
- Checks for referential integrity
- Enforces business rules and constraints
- Prevents invalid data from entering the system

**Usage**:
```python
# Example: Validate a property record before saving
validation_result = framework.validate_property_data(property_data)
if validation_result["valid"]:
    save_property(property_data)
```

#### Security Monitoring Agent

**Purpose**: Protects system and data from unauthorized access and security threats.

**Key Functions**:
- Monitors access patterns for suspicious activity
- Detects potential security breaches
- Enforces access control policies
- Logs security-related events

**Usage**:
```python
# Example: Check if an operation is permitted
if framework.check_security_permission(user_id, "edit", property_id):
    perform_edit_operation()
```

#### Data Recovery Agent

**Purpose**: Provides intelligent data recovery capabilities in case of data corruption or loss.

**Key Functions**:
- Creates intelligent backups of critical data
- Enables point-in-time recovery
- Repairs corrupted data when possible
- Assists in disaster recovery scenarios

**Usage**:
```python
# Example: Recover property data to a specific point in time
recovered_data = framework.recover_property_data(
    property_id="P12345",
    timestamp="2025-03-15T14:30:00Z"
)
```

#### Predictive Analytics Agent

**Purpose**: Analyzes historical data to predict future trends and potential issues.

**Key Functions**:
- Predicts future anomalies based on historical patterns
- Identifies properties at risk of valuation issues
- Forecasts data stability metrics
- Provides early warnings for potential problems

**Usage**:
```python
# Example: Get predictions for potential anomalies in the next 7 days
predictions = framework.get_anomaly_predictions(days_ahead=7)
```

#### Property Valuation Agent

**Purpose**: Provides AI-powered property valuations and market analysis.

**Key Functions**:
- Generates accurate property valuations using ML techniques
- Analyzes comparable properties for valuation
- Identifies market trends affecting property values
- Provides confidence scores and value ranges

**Usage**:
```python
# Example: Get a detailed property valuation
valuation = framework.get_property_valuation(
    property_id="P12345",
    valuation_type="detailed"
)
```

## Agent Communication Patterns

Agents communicate through a centralized message broker using standardized message formats. This allows for:

1. **Direct Communication**: One agent can send a specific message to another agent
2. **Broadcast Messages**: An agent can send a message to all agents or a subset
3. **Task Delegation**: Complex tasks can be broken down and distributed among specialized agents
4. **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Multiple agents can work together on complex issues

## Monitoring and Management

The AI agent ecosystem includes comprehensive monitoring tools:

1. **Agent Dashboard**: Visualizes the status and performance of all agents
2. **Health Monitoring**: Automatically detects and reports agent issues
3. **Performance Metrics**: Tracks key performance indicators for each agent
4. **Audit Logging**: Records all significant agent actions for accountability

## Extending the Agent Ecosystem

New agent types can be added by:

1. Creating a new agent class inheriting from the base AIAgent class
2. Implementing required methods (run, process_message, etc.)
3. Registering the new agent type with the agent manager
4. Creating instances of the agent through the manager

Example:
```python
# Define a new agent type
class MarketAnalysisAgent(AIAgent):
    def __init__(self, agent_id, name, description):
        super().__init__(agent_id, name, description, 
                        ["market_analysis", "trend_detection"])
        # Agent-specific initialization
    
    def _process_task(self, task_data):
        # Implementation
        pass

# Register the new agent type
framework.agent_manager.register_agent_type("market_analysis", MarketAnalysisAgent)

# Create an instance
market_agent = framework.agent_manager.create_agent(
    agent_type="market_analysis",
    name="MarketAnalysisAgent",
    description="Analyzes real estate market trends"
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Fault Tolerance**: Agents should handle errors gracefully and not affect system stability
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Agents should be mindful of computational resources
3. **Semantic Messaging**: Messages between agents should use clear semantic structures
4. **Security Awareness**: All agents must respect security boundaries and access controls
5. **Audit Trail**: Important decisions and actions should be properly logged

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Agent not responding | Resource exhaustion | Restart agent and check resource allocation |
| Excessive false positives | Sensitivity too high | Adjust agent configuration thresholds |
| High latency | Message queue backlog | Check system load and consider scaling |
| Missing alerts | Incorrect configuration | Verify alert routing and threshold settings |

For more detailed troubleshooting, consult the system logs or contact the system administrator.
