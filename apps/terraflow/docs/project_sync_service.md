# Project Sync Service Documentation

## Overview

The DatabaseProjectSyncService is an enhanced database synchronization tool designed to securely and efficiently synchronize data between multiple database environments. This service is particularly useful for project-related data that needs to be synchronized between development, testing, and production environments.

## Key Features

- **Bidirectional Synchronization**: Sync data in both directions with clear conflict resolution strategies
- **Schema Validation**: Automatic detection and validation of database schemas to prevent data corruption
- **Conflict Detection and Resolution**: Sophisticated conflict detection with multiple resolution strategies
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently handle large datasets through batched operations
- **Transaction Support**: Ensure data integrity with transaction support
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Monitor synchronization progress through a user-friendly dashboard
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging of all operations for troubleshooting and auditing

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Service

The Project Sync Service can be accessed through the main navigation menu:

1. Log in to the application
2. Click on "Admin" in the main navigation menu
3. Select "Project Sync Service" from the dropdown menu

### Setting Up Database Connections

Before using the sync service, you need to configure database connections:

1. Go to the Project Sync Settings page
2. Click on "Add Connection" button
3. Enter a unique name for the connection
4. Select the database type (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
5. Enter the connection string
6. Click "Add Connection" to save

### Running a Sync Job

To synchronize data between two database environments:

1. Go to the Project Sync Dashboard
2. Click on "New Sync Job" button
3. Select source and target database connections
4. Configure the conflict resolution strategy
5. Enable/disable schema validation as needed
6. Click "Start Sync" to begin the process

## Conflict Resolution

The sync service provides several strategies for handling conflicts:

### Automatic Strategies

- **Source Wins**: Always use data from the source database
- **Target Wins**: Always keep data in the target database
- **Newer Wins**: Use the record with the most recent timestamp
- **Ignore**: Skip conflicts without making changes

### Manual Resolution

For complex conflicts, the service provides a manual resolution interface:

1. Go to the Conflicts list page
2. Click on a conflict to view details
3. Review the differences between source and target data
4. Choose a resolution strategy or manually specify values for each field
5. Add resolution notes for future reference
6. Click "Resolve Conflict" to apply the changes

### Bulk Resolution

For multiple conflicts of the same type:

1. Go to the Conflicts list page
2. Apply filters to select the desired conflicts
3. Use the "Bulk Resolution" section at the bottom of the page
4. Select a resolution strategy
5. Add optional notes
6. Click "Apply to All Pending" to resolve all matching conflicts

## Scheduled Synchronization

To automate synchronization tasks:

1. Go to the Project Sync Settings page
2. Enable "Scheduled Synchronization"
3. Choose schedule type (daily, weekly, monthly)
4. Set time and other schedule parameters
5. Provide a name for the scheduled job
6. Save the settings

## Monitoring and Management

### Dashboard

The Project Sync Dashboard provides an overview of:

- Recent sync jobs and their status
- Pending conflicts requiring attention
- System health indicators
- Performance metrics

### Job Details

For each sync job, you can view:

- Processing status and progress
- Record counts (total, processed, errors)
- Duration and performance statistics
- Detailed logs of operations
- Associated conflicts

### System Settings

The Settings page allows you to configure:

- Default connection settings
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Batch size and performance parameters
- Notification preferences
- Schema validation options

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Failures**
   - Check that database servers are accessible
   - Verify connection strings are correct
   - Ensure proper network connectivity
   - Check for firewall restrictions

2. **Schema Validation Errors**
   - Review the schema differences in the validation report
   - Update the target schema if needed
   - Enable auto-migration for minor differences
   - Manually resolve major schema differences

3. **Conflict Resolution Failures**
   - Examine the specific conflict details
   - Check for any constraints or triggers that might be preventing updates
   - Look for data type mismatches
   - Consider using manual resolution for complex conflicts

### Error Logs

For more detailed troubleshooting:

1. Navigate to the Job Details page
2. Review the "Logs" section for error messages
3. Check the application logs for additional details

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with smaller tables when first using the service
2. **Test First**: Always test sync operations in development/test environments first
3. **Use Appropriate Scheduling**: Set up schedules during low-traffic periods
4. **Regular Maintenance**: Periodically review and resolve any pending conflicts
5. **Document Decisions**: Use the notes field to document resolution decisions
6. **Review Performance**: Monitor job performance and adjust batch sizes as needed

## Support

For additional support or to report issues:

- Use the feedback form within the application
- Contact the system administrator
- Reference the job ID when reporting specific sync problems
