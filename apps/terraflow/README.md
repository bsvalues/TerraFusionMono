# TerraFlow

A comprehensive Geographic Information System (GIS) and property assessment platform for the Benton County Assessor's Office, featuring advanced data quality management, validation capabilities, and integration with Supabase. Part of the TerraFusion Platform.

## Overview

TerraFlow provides a sophisticated platform for managing Geographic Information System (GIS) data with enhanced data quality monitoring, valuation capabilities, and Supabase integration. The application supports multiple environments (development, training, production) and serves as a central hub that coordinates with specialized modules for property assessment tasks.

## Features

- Python-based backend with Flask
- PostgreSQL GIS database integration
- Advanced data quality monitoring
- Machine learning property assessment
- Interactive data visualization
- Comprehensive regional property knowledge base
- Secure authentication (LDAP and Supabase)
- API for third-party applications and microservices

## Setting Up Supabase Integration

### Prerequisites

1. Create a Supabase account at [https://supabase.io](https://supabase.io)
2. Create a new Supabase project
3. Get your Supabase URL and API key from the project settings

### Configuration

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
# Supabase configuration
export SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
export SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-api-key

# Enable Supabase integration
export USE_SUPABASE=true
```

### Database Setup

The system will automatically create tables in Supabase based on the SQLAlchemy models. Additionally, ensure your Supabase project has the PostgreSQL extensions enabled for spatial data:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Select "Database" from the sidebar
3. Click on "Extensions"
4. Enable the following extensions:
   - `postgis`
   - `uuid-ossp`
   - `pg_stat_statements`

### Authentication Setup

To use Supabase for authentication:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Select "Authentication" from the sidebar
3. Configure the desired sign-in methods (email, OAuth providers, etc.)
4. Set the proper redirect URLs in the Authentication settings

For local development, set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:5000/auth/callback`.

## API Integration

The system provides a comprehensive API for third-party applications and microservices to interact with the Benton County GIS system. See the [API Documentation](api/README.md) for details.

## Connection Management

For microservices and third-party applications that need database access, the system provides a connection management facility to ensure proper connection pooling, load balancing, and security. See the [API Documentation](api/README.md) for details on integrating with this system.

## Storage Integration

The system supports both local file storage and Supabase Storage. When Supabase integration is enabled, all files will be stored in Supabase Storage buckets, providing:

- Automatic backup
- Enhanced security
- CDN delivery
- Easy access control

## Multi-Environment Support

TerraFlow supports multiple environments for development, training, and production deployments. Each environment can have its own database, Supabase project, and configuration settings.

### Environment Setup

To set up a new environment:

```bash
# Initialize a development environment (default)
python initialize_environment.py development

# Initialize a training environment
python initialize_environment.py training --database-url postgresql://user:pass@host:port/training_db

# Initialize a production environment
python initialize_environment.py production --database-url postgresql://user:pass@host:port/production_db
```

You can also provide Supabase configuration for each environment:

```bash
python initialize_environment.py training \
  --database-url postgresql://user:pass@host:port/training_db \
  --supabase-url https://your-training-project.supabase.co \
  --supabase-key your_supabase_key \
  --supabase-service-key your_supabase_service_key
```

### Switching Environments

To switch between environments:

```bash
# Switch to development environment
python switch_environment.py development

# Switch to training environment
python switch_environment.py training

# Switch to production environment
python switch_environment.py production
```

### Deployment Process

For deploying to different environments:

```bash
# Deploy to development (runs migrations and restarts the application)
python deploy.py development

# Deploy to training
python deploy.py training

# Deploy to production
python deploy.py production --skip-migrations
```

You can customize the deployment process with flags:

```bash
# Skip database migrations
python deploy.py production --skip-migrations

# Skip restarting the application
python deploy.py training --skip-restart

# Skip deployment verification
python deploy.py training --skip-verify
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Flask
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS extensions
- SQLAlchemy
- Supabase Python client (for Supabase integration)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/benton-county/terraflow.git
cd terraflow

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Initialize development environment
python initialize_environment.py development

# Start the application
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --reload main:app
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the test suite
pytest

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=app tests/
```

## Deployment

For production deployment, we recommend using Gunicorn:

```bash
# Initialize production environment
python initialize_environment.py production

# Deploy to production
python deploy.py production

# Start the server manually if needed
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --workers 4 --threads 2 main:app
```
