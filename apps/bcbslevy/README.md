## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- PostgreSQL database
- Anthropic API key (for AI features)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
   SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

### Database Management

The application provides comprehensive tools for database management:

#### Quick Commands

```bash
# Create a database backup
python cli_tool.py backup

# Verify database connectivity
python cli_tool.py verify

# Display database information
python cli_tool.py info
```

#### Database Migrations

The application uses Flask-Migrate for database schema changes with enhanced production tools:

```bash
# Development migrations
python migrate.py migrate -m "Description of changes"
python migrate.py upgrade

# Production migrations with safety features
python production_migrate.py backup    # Create backup before migration
python production_migrate.py migrate   # Apply migrations with safety checks
python production_migrate.py verify    # Verify successful migration
```
