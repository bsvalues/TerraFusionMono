The base levy rate of 3.25 per $1,000 of assessed value is within the statutory maximum of 3.60.\n\n3. With the voter-approved enrichment levy of 1.50, the total levy rate is 4.75, which is compliant with state law given the voter approval.\n\n4. The calculated levy amount of $6,919,747.75 matches the manual calculation (total assessed value ร total rate รท 1000).\n\n5.
