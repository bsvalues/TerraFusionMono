## Replit AI Agent Instructions: 24-Hour LevyMaster Demo Preparation

I need you to prepare our LevyMaster application for an impressive demo within 24 hours. Work autonomously to optimize the application for demonstration, focusing on visual impact and stability rather than developing new features.

## Project Context

LevyMaster is our property tax levy management platform designed for the Benton County Assessor's Office. The application helps county officials calculate, manage, and distribute property tax levies across multiple taxing districts. The application needs to be prepared for a compelling demonstration that showcases its key capabilities in levy management, tax district configuration, and reporting.

## Technical Guidelines

### Focus Areas
- **Prioritize calculation accuracy** in all levy formulas
- **Optimize visual presentation** of tax distribution data
- **Ensure intuitive workflow** for levy management processes

### Implementation Approach
- Use existing components wherever possible
- Focus on configuration and optimization rather than new development
- Ensure all calculations are accurate and verifiable

### Data Handling
- Use realistic but sanitized county data
- Ensure data illustrates various tax scenarios clearly
- Pre-process data to remove any sensitive information

## Decision-Making Framework

When facing implementation decisions, prioritize in this order:
1. Calculation accuracy and data integrity
2. Visual impact and clarity of presentations
3. Workflow efficiency and usability
4. Performance and responsiveness

For any technical issue, decide whether to:
1. Fix the issue (if quick and critical)
2. Create a workaround (if complex but needed)
3. Exclude from demo (if non-critical)

## Success Criteria

The demo preparation is successful when:
1. All levy calculations are accurate and clearly presented
2. The tax district management workflow is intuitive and visual
3. Distribution analysis provides clear insights and comparisons
4. The application responds quickly throughout the demo
5. All reports generate correctly and look professional

## Communication Protocol

Generate a progress report after completing each major section, including:
- Tasks completed
- Any issues encountered and resolutions
- Screenshots of key improvements
- Recommendations for the demo approach

## Final Deliverables

At the end of the 24-hour period, provide:
1. Access link to the demo environment
2. Credentials for all demo users
3. Step-by-step demo script
4. Known limitations or issues to be aware of
5. Recommendations for conducting the demo
