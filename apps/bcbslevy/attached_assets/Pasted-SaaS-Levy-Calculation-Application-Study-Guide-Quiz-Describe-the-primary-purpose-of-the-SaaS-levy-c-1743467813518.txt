Quiz Answer Key
The primary purpose of the application is to streamline and manage the process of calculating property tax levies for Benton County. It aims to handle data import, validation, levy calculation based on different tax codes, statutory compliance, and the generation of tax rolls.
The key libraries are Flask (for creating the web application), SQLAlchemy (for database interaction as an Object-Relational Mapper), pandas (optionally, for efficient data manipulation), and gunicorn (for deployment as a WSGI HTTP server).
The import_property_data function is responsible for reading property evaluation data from a file (e.g., CSV). A crucial validation it performs is checking whether all the required columns, such as 'property_id', 'assessed_value', and 'tax_code', exist in the imported data.
SQLAlchemy acts as an ORM, allowing the application to interact with the database using Python objects rather than raw SQL queries. The Property model defines the structure of the property table in the database, specifying the data types and constraints for each attribute like id, property_id, assessed_value, and tax_code.
Calculating the levy rate involves first aggregating the total assessed value of all properties within a specific tax code area. Then, the provided levy amount for that district is divided by the total assessed value and multiplied by 1000 to get the rate per $1,000 of assessed value.
Statutory checks are implemented to ensure that the calculated levy rates comply with legal limitations and regulations. An example of a statutory limit mentioned is a maximum 101% increase over the previous rate, potentially with adjustments for new construction.
The calculate_property_tax function determines an individual property's tax obligation by taking the property's assessed value, dividing it by 1000, and then multiplying the result by the applicable levy rate for that property's tax code.
The administrative dashboard is intended to provide functionalities such as uploading CSV files containing property data, triggering the bulk import of this data into the system, viewing aggregated reports of assessed values and levy calculations, and checking for any warnings related to statutory compliance.
The plan suggests using the Replit AI agent for assistance with various development tasks, including code generation to speed up development, automated tests to ensure code quality, and troubleshooting to help identify and resolve any issues that arise during implementation.
The recommended final steps include thorough testing of all modules to ensure they function correctly, creating comprehensive documentation for both the code itself and user guides for administrators and end-users, and engaging in iterative development based on feedback received after the initial deployment.

Glossary of Key Terms
SaaS (Software as a Service): A software distribution model where a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet.
Levy: An imposition of tax, fee, or fine. In this context, it refers to the amount of tax to be raised from property owners.
Replit: An online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that allows users to write and run code in various programming languages directly in their web browser. It also offers features like collaboration and deployment.
Flask: A lightweight and extensible micro web framework for Python used to build web applications.
SQLAlchemy: A popular Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that provides a high-level way to interact with databases.
ORM (Object-Relational Mapper): A programming technique that converts data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. In this context, it maps database tables to Python classes and rows to objects.
pandas: A powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis, often used for working with structured data like CSV files and tables.
gunicorn: A Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX, used for deploying Python web applications.
CSV (Comma Separated Values): A simple file format used to store tabular data, where values in each record are separated by commas.
SQLite: A lightweight, file-based relational database management system that requires no separate server process. Replit provides it as a default option.
Tax Code: A geographical or jurisdictional identifier assigned to properties, which determines the applicable tax rates and districts.
Assessed Value: The value assigned to a property by a taxing authority for the purpose of calculating property taxes.
Levy Rate: The rate at which property tax is calculated, often expressed as a rate per $1,000 of assessed value.
Statutory Limits: Legally mandated restrictions or caps, such as limits on the percentage increase of levy rates.
Tax Roll: A public record listing all taxable properties within a jurisdiction, along with their assessed values and the amount of tax owed.
API (Application Programming Interface): A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and exchange data with each other. (While not explicitly detailed, the application will have internal APIs for module interaction).
Version Control: A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is a common version control system, and Replit has built-in Git integration.
Unit Tests: Automated tests written to verify that individual units or components of the software (e.g., functions, modules) are working correctly.
Continuous Integration (CI): A development practice where code changes are frequently integrated into a shared repository and automatically tested.
