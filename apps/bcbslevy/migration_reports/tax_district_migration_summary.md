# Tax District Migration Summary

## Migration Overview

**Date:** April 11, 2025  
**Purpose:** Resolve technical debt by updating foreign key references from legacy `tax_district_old` table to current `tax_district` table

## Changes Made

The following foreign key constraints were successfully migrated:

| Table | Original Constraint | New Constraint | Status |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|--------|
| levy_rate | levy_rate_tax_district_id_fkey | levy_rate_tax_district_id_fkey | ✅ Migrated |
| forecast | forecast_tax_district_id_fkey | forecast_tax_district_id_fkey | ✅ Migrated |
| compliance_issue | compliance_issue_tax_district_id_fkey | compliance_issue_tax_district_id_fkey | ✅ Migrated |

## Verification Results

All three tables now properly reference the `tax_district` table with appropriate foreign key constraints. No tables reference the legacy `tax_district_old` table anymore.

## Database Schema Impact

This migration improves the database schema by:

1. **Eliminating Technical Debt**: Removing references to the legacy table
2. **Ensuring Data Integrity**: All references now point to the current table with proper constraints
3. **Simplifying Schema**: Making the data model more consistent and easier to understand

## Next Steps

1. **Application Testing**: Verify that all application features that use these relationships continue to function correctly
2. **Data Cleanup**: Consider if the legacy `tax_district_old` table can be archived or removed
3. **Documentation Update**: Update system documentation to reflect current schema

## Migration Scripts

Two scripts were created for this migration:

1. `migrate_tax_district_references.py` - Performs the actual migration
2. `test_tax_district_migration.py` - Tests the migration process

These scripts are available in the project root directory and may be useful for reference in future migrations.
