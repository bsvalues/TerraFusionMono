# Command Hierarchy Structure for the Multi-Agent System

## Overview

This document outlines the command hierarchy structure for the Benton County Property Valuation System's multi-agent architecture. The system follows a hierarchical organization inspired by the BCBS GeoAssessment Strategic Guide, with specialized agent roles for improved organization, responsibility segregation, and enhanced collaboration.

## Command Structure

The command structure implements a specialized roles hierarchy to coordinate the AI components effectively:

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │  Core System    │
                    │  Orchestrator   │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
                    ┌────────┴────────┐
                    │ Master Control  │
                    │ Program (MCP)   │
                    └───┬───────┬─────┘
                        │       │
        ┌───────────────┘       └───────────────┐
        │                                       │
┌───────┴───────┐                      ┌────────┴──────┐
│ Architect     │                      │ Integration   │
│ Prime Agent   │                      │ Coordinator   │
└───────┬───────┘                      └────────┬──────┘
        │                                       │
        │                                       │
┌───────┴───────┐                      ┌────────┴──────┐
│ Component     │                      │  Specialized  │
│ Lead Agents   │                      │  Agents       │
└───────────────┘                      └───────────────┘

## Agent Roles and Responsibilities

### Strategic Command Layer

#### Core System Orchestrator
- **Role**: Central coordination component of the AI system
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manages the Master Control Program (MCP)
  - Provides high-level coordination of all agents
  - Monitors system health and performance
  - Maintains the system's master prompt
  - Registers agents with the MCP
  - Handles system-wide broadcasts

#### Master Control Program (MCP)
- **Role**: Coordination component that manages message routing
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Routes messages between agents
  - Manages agent registration and capability registry
  - Maintains the replay buffer for experience collection
  - Handles message queuing and processing
  - Monitors agent health

### Command Structure Layer

#### Architect Prime Agent
- **Role**: Maintains architectural vision and system integrity
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Preserves system architectural vision
  - Generates system architecture diagrams
  - Performs architectural reviews
  - Provides architectural guidance
  - Makes high-level architectural decisions
  - Broadcasts vision statements to guide development

#### Integration Coordinator Agent
- **Role**: Manages cross-component integration
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Coordinates integration between system components
  - Validates API contracts
  - Monitors integration health
  - Maps dependencies between components
  - Provides integration assistance
  - Registers integration points
  - Identifies and resolves integration issues

### Operational Layer (Future Implementation)

#### Component Lead Agents
- **Role**: Leads specialized domains (to be implemented)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Oversee agent teams within specific domains
  - Coordinate activities within their area of expertise
  - Validate domain-specific outputs
  - Ensure domain best practices are followed
  - Report to strategic layer agents

#### Specialized Agents (Existing)
- **Valuation Agents**: Calculate property values based on income data
- **Data Cleaner Agents**: Detect and fix data anomalies
- **Reporting Agents**: Generate insights and reports from valuation data

## Communication Protocol

Agents communicate using a standardized message format defined in the `AgentProtocol.ts` module. This ensures consistent communication through:

1. **Event Types**: Standardized message types (REQUEST, RESPONSE, BROADCAST, etc.)
2. **Message Correlation**: Messages are linked through correlationId
3. **Payload Structure**: Consistent data structures for various interactions
4. **Error Handling**: Standardized error codes and reporting mechanisms

## Implementation Status

| Agent Type | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Core System Orchestrator | Implemented | Fully functional |
| Master Control Program | Implemented | Fully functional |
| Architect Prime Agent | Implemented | Basic functionality |
| Integration Coordinator Agent | Implemented | Basic functionality |
| Component Lead Agents | Planned | Future implementation |
| Valuation Agents | Implemented | Fully functional |
| Data Cleaner Agents | Implemented | Fully functional |
| Reporting Agents | Implemented | Fully functional |

## Future Enhancements

1. **Component Lead Implementation**: Add specialized domain leaders for valuation, data cleaning, and reporting.
2. **Enhanced Learning Mechanisms**: Improve the replay buffer to support priority-based experience retrieval.
3. **Automated Testing Agents**: Add agents specifically for testing and validating other agents' functionality.
4. **Dynamic Configuration**: Allow real-time adjustment of agent behavior through configuration updates.
5. **Self-healing Mechanisms**: Enable the system to automatically recover from common failure scenarios.

## Benefits of the Command Structure

1. **Clearer Responsibility Segregation**: Each agent has well-defined roles and responsibilities.
2. **Improved Scalability**: Hierarchical structure allows for easier addition of new agents.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Better visibility into the system's operation through specialized monitoring agents.
4. **Strategic Direction**: Architect Prime ensures the system maintains architectural integrity.
5. **Smooth Integration**: Integration Coordinator ensures components work together effectively.
6. **Standardized Communication**: Consistent message formats and protocols across the system.

## Conclusion

The command hierarchy provides a structured approach to organizing the multi-agent system, with clear lines of communication and responsibility. This structure supports both current functionality and future expansion while ensuring architectural integrity and effective integration.
