Project Overview
You are an experienced Full-Stack AI Architect tasked with building a Customer Support Application that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). The system must integrate seamlessly into our existing infrastructure, prioritize data security and compliance, and enable a clear path for ongoing enhancements and feature expansions.

1. Core Functionalities & Roadmap

Dynamic Roadmap & Jira Integration
Integrate with our existing Jira boards to automatically update tickets, track progress, and reflect real-time status changes.
Provide a dashboard to visualize the development roadmap at a granular level (sprints, tasks, subtasks) and high-level milestones.
AI-Driven Troubleshooting & Ticket Analysis
The application should flag tickets that lack sufficient information and request additional details from users automatically.
Suggest relevant articles from the knowledge base or FAQ to users before a ticket is escalated, reducing overall resolution time.
Modular File/Folder Structure
Create a specialized support_agents folder (or module) dedicated to custom AI agents for various support tasks—ticket triage, automated replies, user sentiment analysis, etc.
Follow best practices for separating front-end, back-end, DevOps scripts, and AI-related code.
Development Environment (Docker Compose)
Provide a Docker Compose setup that allows any remote developer to spin up an identical environment locally.
Ensure all microservices (backend API, LLM service, database, etc.) can be run and tested in isolation or collectively.
Documentation & API Endpoints
Thoroughly document all APIs for ticketing, knowledge base updates, AI agent interactions, and user management.
Include architecture diagrams, environment setup guides, and usage examples (such as cURL/Postman requests).
AI Agent Playground
Include a web-based “playground” environment where developers and support leads can fine-tune or experiment with conversation flows, FAQ data, and real historical transcripts.
Provide versioning so that each iteration of the model (or prompt) is stored and can be rolled back if needed.
Kubernetes-Based Deployment
Deploy the entire stack to a Kubernetes cluster.
Configure auto-scaling rules based on ticket volume and concurrency, ensuring minimal downtime and cost-effectiveness.
AI-Driven Testing & Continuous Feedback
Implement automated tests for AI responses (checking correctness, completeness, tone).
Collect continuous feedback from user satisfaction scores (e.g., star ratings, survey results) and automatically retrain or update LLM prompts based on performance.
Store historical tickets for model fine-tuning and to inform better answers over time.
2. Constraints & Considerations

Security & Compliance
Must adhere to data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, or internal compliance standards).
Sensitive ticket data should be encrypted at rest and in transit.
Access control and audit logs for all AI interactions.
Scalability & Reliability
System must handle peak loads gracefully (e.g., sudden influx of tickets).
Use caching or rate limiting to protect LLM endpoints from being overwhelmed.
Customization & Extensibility
The design should allow easy addition of new features (e.g., new AI agents for billing questions, advanced sentiment analysis) without major refactoring.
Provide plugin-like architecture for integrating third-party services, such as payment processors or additional knowledge-base modules.
Team Collaboration & Workflow
The solution must be maintainable by a distributed team with varied skill sets (front-end, back-end, ML/AI, DevOps).
Each microservice or major feature should have an assigned owner in the Jira board.
3. Deliverables & Success Criteria

Source Code
A complete, well-structured repository (or set of repositories) that includes front-end, back-end, and AI components.
A docker-compose.yml (and possibly helm charts or Kubernetes manifests) for local and production deployment.
Technical Documentation
Architectural overview diagram showing data flow and microservice interactions.
API specs detailing endpoints, request/response formats, authentication, and error handling.
CI/CD pipeline instructions, including testing strategies and rollout procedures.
AI Agent Playground
Fully functional UI for prompt engineering, dataset uploads, and model fine-tuning experiments.
Logging and versioning of all changes.
Live Deployment
A Kubernetes deployment that auto-scales based on ticket volume, with a dedicated test environment (staging) mirroring production.
Implementation of real-time monitoring and alerting for performance metrics (CPU, memory) and business metrics (tickets per minute, resolution time).
Testing & Feedback Loops
Automated tests (unit, integration, AI content validation).
Mechanism to collect user feedback on AI-generated solutions, store it, and feed it back into iterative training.
Performance baseline: Aim for at least a 30% reduction in average ticket resolution time compared to our current system.
4. Next Steps

Requirements Confirmation: Verify each item with the product team and clarify any ambiguous points (e.g., license costs for certain LLM providers).
Rapid Prototype: Build a minimal viable product (MVP) focusing on core AI triage and knowledge base integration.
Testing & Iteration: Use real or synthetic data to refine AI responses; gather feedback from a beta group of support agents.
Production Rollout: Migrate existing tickets, launch a pilot with limited user groups, and monitor performance before full rollout.
Objective
By the end of this project, deliver a robust, scalable, and AI-driven Customer Support system that improves resolution speed, reduces operational overhead, and enhances user satisfaction through intelligent ticket analysis, self-service, and continuous learning.
