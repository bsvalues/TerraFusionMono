Quiz Answer Key
1.
The application interacts with MS SQL Server and PostgreSQL. It uses connection strings defined in environment variables to establish connections. For PostgreSQL, it initializes a ThreadedConnectionPool for managing connections, while for MS SQL Server, it establishes a new connection for each request within a context manager.
2.
APIKeyHeader defines the expected HTTP header (x-api-key) for API key authentication. The get_api_key dependency function verifies the presence and validity of this key against the settings.API_KEY, raising an HTTPException for missing or invalid keys. This addresses unauthorized access to the API endpoints.
3.
The /tools/run_sql_query endpoint allows clients to execute SQL queries against a specified database (mssql or postgres). Before execution, the is_safe_query function performs a basic check for potentially harmful SQL keywords (e.g., DROP, DELETE) to prevent SQL injection.
4.
Pydantic BaseModel is used to define the structure and validation rules for request and response bodies. For example, the SQLQuery model defines the expected fields (db and query) and their types and constraints (e.g., using constr for string constraints and regex).
5.
The /tools/discover_schema endpoint retrieves and returns the schema information for a specified database (mssql or postgres). It fetches the table names, column names, and data types from the database's information schema and returns them in a structured JSON format.
6.
The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware configures which origins (domains) are allowed to make HTTP requests to the API. It is important for security, preventing unauthorized websites from making requests to the API from a different domain than the one that served the web page.
7.
The context managers get_mssql_connection and get_postgres_connection are used to safely acquire and release database connections. They ensure that a connection is established, yielded for use within the with block, and then properly closed (for MSSQL) or returned to the pool (for PostgreSQL), even if errors occur.
8.
The /tools/nl_to_sql endpoint is intended to convert natural language prompts into SQL queries. The provided code includes a placeholder that simulates this functionality by returning a hardcoded SQL query based on the prompt. In a real implementation, this would likely involve integration with a natural language processing model.
9.
The /health endpoint checks the operational status of the API and its database connections. It returns a JSON response indicating whether the API is "ok" and the connection status (True or False) for both MS SQL Server and PostgreSQL. This is useful for monitoring and ensuring the API's dependencies are functioning correctly.
10.
The Settings class is used to manage the application's configuration, such as API keys, database connection strings, allowed CORS origins, and maximum result limits. These values are typically loaded from environment variables using os.getenv(), allowing for configuration without modifying the code directly.
