MCP Assessor Agent API: Design and Functionality
The provided sources describe the design, security, implementation, and review of an MCP Assessor Agent API, which is a FastAPI application designed to access and query assessment data from Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL databases [1-3]. This API provides functionalities such as executing SQL queries, translating natural language to SQL, discovering database schema, and checking the health of the API and its database connections [1].
However, the sources do not contain information or instructions on how to create files for Replit AI development with the described API agent [all sources]. The sources focus on the backend implementation and functionalities of the API itself, not on how to integrate it into a Replit AI development environment.
To clarify, the MCP Assessor Agent API, as described in the sources:
•
Provides an intermediary layer to access and query data in MS SQL Server and PostgreSQL databases [1, 3].
•
Offers endpoints for executing SQL queries (/tools/run_sql_query) and (in a simulated manner) converting natural language to SQL (/tools/nl_to_sql) [4, 5].
•
Includes features for exploring database schema (/tools/discover_schema, /tools/get_schema_summary) [6].
•
Implements basic security measures like API key authentication [1, 7].
•
Manages database connections using connection pooling for PostgreSQL and context managers for both database types [4].
•
Exposes a health check endpoint (/health) [8].
The sources do not provide any information about:
•
Replit AI development: How to use Replit's AI features or integrate external APIs within that environment.
•
File creation for development: Instructions or templates for creating files specific to a Replit AI project using this API.
Therefore, based on the information available in the sources, I cannot provide you with the specific files needed for Replit AI development with this API agent. You may need to consult Replit's documentation or resources for information on their AI development environment and how to integrate external APIs within it.
