MCP Assessor Agent API: Review and Proposed Improvements
Briefing Document: MCP Assessor Agent API Review
Date: October 26, 2023Prepared For: [Intended Audience - e.g., Development Team, Security Team, Project Management]Subject: Review of MCP Assessor Agent API Code and Proposed Improvements
This document provides a detailed review of the provided FastAPI code for the MCP Assessor Agent API and summarizes the key themes, important ideas, and proposed improvements highlighted in the subsequent analysis.
1. Main Themes of the API Code
The provided code outlines a FastAPI application designed to act as an intermediary service for accessing and querying assessment data stored in both MS SQL Server and PostgreSQL databases. The core functionalities include:
•
SQL Query Execution: Allows users to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the specified database.
•
Natural Language to SQL Conversion: Intends to translate natural language prompts into SQL queries (currently a simulated response).
•
Database Schema Discovery: Enables retrieval of the database schema (tables, columns, data types).
•
Schema Summarization: Provides a summarized view of the database schema, potentially filtered by a prefix.
•
Security: Implements basic API key-based authentication.
•
Configuration: Utilizes environment variables for configuration parameters like API keys and database connection strings.
•
Logging: Includes basic logging for informational and error messages.
•
Health Check: Offers an endpoint to check the API's and database connection status.
2. Key Ideas and Facts from the API Code
•
FastAPI Framework: The API is built using the FastAPI framework, leveraging its features for automatic data validation, serialization, and API documentation.
•
Database Connectivity: It supports connections to both MS SQL Server (using pyodbc) and PostgreSQL (using psycopg2). Connection pooling is implemented for PostgreSQL but not explicitly for MS SQL Server (connections are created and closed per request using a context manager).
•
API Key Authentication: Basic API key authentication is implemented via a custom dependency (get_api_key) that checks for the presence and validity of an x-api-key header. The API key is configured through the MCP_API_KEY environment variable. The code includes a fallback mechanism to generate a secure API key if none is provided or if it's too short, logging a warning in such cases:
"No API key defined. Generating a secure random key." "API key too short. Generating a secure random key."
•
CORS Configuration: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled using starlette.middleware.cors.CORSMiddleware. The allowed origins are configured via the ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable, with a default to ["http://localhost:3000"] if none are specified:
"No CORS origins specified. Setting to localhost only."
•
Input and Output Validation: Pydantic models (SQLQuery, NLPrompt, QueryResult, etc.) are used for request and response data validation and serialization.
•
SQL Injection Prevention (Basic): A simple function is_safe_query attempts to prevent basic SQL injection by checking for the presence of potentially dangerous SQL keywords:
"Basic SQL injection prevention" unsafe_patterns = ["DROP ", "DELETE ", "UPDATE ", "INSERT ", "ALTER ", "TRUNCATE ", "CREATE ", "GRANT ", "EXEC ", "EXECUTE "]
•
Result Limiting: A MAX_RESULTS setting (defaulting to 50) limits the number of records returned by the /tools/run_sql_query endpoint.
•
Error Handling: Basic try...except blocks are used to catch database errors (PyodbcError, PostgresError) and other exceptions, returning appropriate HTTP error responses.
•
Schema Discovery Queries: Specific SQL queries are used to retrieve schema information from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS (for both MSSQL and PostgreSQL).
•
Health Endpoint: The /health endpoint checks the status of the API and attempts to establish connections to both configured databases.
3. Analysis and Recommendations from the Second Source
The analysis of the provided FastAPI code highlights several key areas for improvement across security, performance, reliability, and API design.
3.1. Security Considerations:
•
API Key Exposure: The analysis points out that a fallback devkey (though not explicitly present in the first code snippet, the dynamic generation of keys if none are provided or too short can be considered a similar risk if not managed carefully) creates a predictable authentication token. Recommendation: Ensure strong, randomly generated API keys are always used and securely managed.
•
SQL Injection Vulnerability: The direct execution of user-supplied queries, even with the basic is_safe_query function, is identified as a significant SQL injection vulnerability. Recommendation: Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. The analysis explicitly states: "SQL injection prevention through query validation" as a key improvement in the refactored version (though the refactored code itself was not provided).
•
Excessive Data Exposure: The direct use of environment variables without secure handling patterns is flagged as a risk. Recommendation: Implement more robust configuration management, potentially using secrets management tools for sensitive information.
•
Broad CORS Configuration: The wildcard origin "*" (which is not present in the provided code, as it defaults to localhost if ALLOWED_ORIGINS is empty) is mentioned as allowing requests from any domain. Recommendation: Restrict CORS to only explicitly trusted origins. The analysis notes "Restricted CORS configuration to specified origins" as a key improvement.
3.2. Performance & Reliability Issues:
•
Connection Management: The creation of database connections for each request (especially for MS SQL Server) without connection pooling is highlighted as a performance bottleneck. Recommendation: Implement connection pooling for both MS SQL Server and PostgreSQL. The analysis points to "Connection pooling for PostgreSQL" and "Context managers for connection handling" as improvements.
•
Error Handling: The use of generic exceptions and their direct exposure to clients is considered problematic. Recommendation: Use specific exception types and sanitize error messages to prevent information leakage. The analysis emphasizes "Specific exception types with appropriate HTTP status codes" and "Sanitized error messages to prevent information leakage".
•
Result Limitation: The hard-coded limit of 50 results without pagination is seen as a limitation. Recommendation: Implement pagination to handle large datasets more effectively. The analysis suggests "Result pagination with metadata" as an enhancement.
3.3. API Design Improvements:
The analysis implicitly praises the existing use of Pydantic models, response models, input validation, and comprehensive documentation (though the latter isn't explicitly in the code but is a general FastAPI benefit). It reinforces the importance of these aspects with the point "Type validation with Pydantic models", "Response models for consistent output format", "Input validation (regex patterns, length constraints)", and "Comprehensive documentation" under "Key Improvements".
3.4. Operational Excellence:
The existing structured logging and health check endpoint are positive aspects. The analysis further recommends "Graceful cleanup of resources on shutdown", which is already implemented in the provided code for the PostgreSQL connection pool.
4. Conclusion
The initial FastAPI code provides a functional foundation for the MCP Assessor Agent API. However, the analysis correctly identifies several critical security vulnerabilities and areas for improvement in performance, reliability, and overall API design. Implementing the recommended changes, particularly around SQL injection prevention, secure API key management, and robust error handling, is crucial for the security and stability of this application. The proposed refactoring, emphasizing security enhancements, database optimization, API design improvements, operational excellence, and refined error handling, represents a significant step towards a more robust and maintainable API.
