# Agent-Assisted Development Framework

## Overview

The Agent-Assisted Development Framework is a sophisticated system that enables AI agents to actively contribute to building and improving the Benton County Assessor's Office AI Platform. This framework allows specialized AI agents to analyze code, generate new components, test changes, and create documentation, making the development process more efficient and effective.

## Key Components

### Agent Coordinator

The `AgentCoordinator` class manages the workflow for assigning development tasks to agents, reviewing their contributions, and integrating their work into the codebase. It supports:

- Task creation and assignment
- Automated agent selection based on task requirements
- Development task lifecycle management
- Codebase analysis and automatic task generation

### Developer Agent

The `DeveloperAgent` class implements a specialized AI agent that can contribute to development tasks. It can:

- Generate new code components based on requirements
- Review and refactor existing code
- Create and improve tests
- Write and update documentation

### Data Validation Agent

The `DataValidationAgent` class represents an agent specialized in data validation for property assessments. It can:

- Validate property data against Washington State standards
- Check for data consistency and completeness
- Identify anomalies in assessment data
- Generate data quality reports

## How It Works

1. The system analyzes the codebase to identify areas for improvement
2. Development tasks are created automatically based on analysis results
3. Tasks are assigned to appropriate agents based on their capabilities
4. Agents execute their assigned tasks and submit code contributions
5. The system integrates the contributions into the codebase

## Demo

The framework includes two demos:

- `simple_demo.py`: A simplified demonstration of the agent-assisted development concept
- `demo.py`: A comprehensive demo showcasing the full capabilities of the framework (requires core module)

To run the simplified demo:

```bash
python agent_coordination/simple_demo.py
```

## Task Types

The framework supports several types of development tasks:

| Task Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| code_generation | Generate new code components |
| code_review | Review and analyze existing code |
| code_improvement | Improve and refactor code |
| testing | Create and improve tests |
| documentation | Write and update documentation |
| data_validation | Validate data against standards |

## Integration with Core System

The framework is designed to integrate with the Enhanced Core Hub system, which provides:

- Standardized message protocols for agent communication
- Agent registration and lifecycle management
- Message routing and delivery
- State persistence and experience replay

## Future Extensions

- Code quality analysis integration with tools like pylint and flake8
- Automated testing and continuous integration
- GitHub integration for pull request creation
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance optimization suggestions

## Benefits

- **Faster Development**: Automates routine coding tasks
- **Higher Quality**: Ensures consistent code quality and test coverage
- **Better Documentation**: Automatically generates and maintains documentation
- **Continuous Improvement**: System gets better over time as it learns from past tasks
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Captures development knowledge in a reusable form
