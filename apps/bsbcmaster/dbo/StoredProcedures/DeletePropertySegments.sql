--Description:
--  This stored procedure deletes all of the segments for the specified property.  This
--  is done when a suspended UDI child property is restored to the parent.  Previously,
--  copies of all of the parent's segments had been made and placed on the child during
--  the suspend process.  These segments should now be removed.
--
--  The following tables must have data deleted:
-- 	imprv
--	imprv_detail
--	imprv_det_adj
--	imprv_mass_adj
--	imprv_adj
--	imprv_owner_assoc
--	imprv_entity_assoc
--	imprv_exemption_assoc
--  imprv_sketch_notes
-- 	land_detail
--	land_owner_assoc
--	land_exemption_assoc
--	land_adj
--	land_mass_adj
--	land_entity_assoc
-- 	pers_prop_seg
