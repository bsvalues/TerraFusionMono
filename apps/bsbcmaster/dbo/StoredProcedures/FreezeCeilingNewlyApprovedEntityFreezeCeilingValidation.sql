create procedure FreezeCeilingNewlyApprovedEntityFreezeCeilingValidation
	@run_id int
as



--	This procedure is for validation of freeze ceilings that will be
--	calculated for the selected year for the freeze ceiling run.


--	NOTE:	report_sort_order exists primarily for sorting of reports and queries.
--		While there is no specific scheme for assigning values to report_sort_order,
--		the intent was to try to group similar types of situations together by using
--		a common value:
--			100-199 are Wizard validation issues
--			200-299 are system-related freeze ceiling validation issues
--			300-399 are property-related validation issues
--			400-499 are supplement validation issues
--			500-599 are entity validation issues
--			600-699 are exemption / qualify year validation issues
--			700-799 are calculation-related validation issues
--			800-899 are used to indicate that a freeze ceiling will be calculated
--
--		The values are also being assigned in the order processed, so it will be
--		easier to identify the order of processing the validation.  Also, there are
--		intentional gaps within each grouping so that new values may be easily
--		inserted, if desired.
