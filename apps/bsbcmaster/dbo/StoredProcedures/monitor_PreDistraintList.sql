/*********



--This monitor was written for Benton to provide them a list of properties subject to distraint.  

--Properties are subject to distraint if no payment has been made toward the year specified OR 

--if any property has a balance due for a year prior to the year specified.  



--This list can be used as a review prior to the distraint process.



Requirements from Barb Bader

Question 1:  This query should be returning properties subject to distraint and there are 2 situations that will cause a property to be subject to distraint. 

1)	If the tax year (display_year) specified has nothing paid to the first half of that year and the first half due date is 4/30 of the tax year.

2)	If the property has any balance due for any year prior to the tax year specified.



Question 2:  The input will be display_year.  Display_year is a computed field based on year (year + 1). 

  I don’t know if it’s easier to build an index on display_year or just calculate year for purposes of the query.
