   Edited for Benton 2/24/2017 per Sam and Teri request     
   Currently the distribution export for Benton is handled thru a monitor the following monitors are what is used for Payments and Misc. Receipts
1.	Misc. Receipts Export
2.	Payments Receipts Export
For the Payments Receipts Export all cash entries need to be striped—the GL handles these transactions as part of the upload process.  Cash transactions are all entries which are ID 0000101.111.10—ID 7902
Also for the Payment Receipts Export any entry related to ID 8666,8667,8668,8669,8664,8670 should be coded as an B in the export file rather than an R
Also converted debit amounts to negative numbers...

4/10/2017: Barb modified the script to exclude another cash account (8852: 0128101.111.10) per HS 169362.

2/26/2018: Barb modified the ARExport to pull just the AR Transactions.   This will be run annually when the new year bills are created.
2/26/2018: Barb created the ADJExport to pull just theADJTransactions. This will be run regularly to track the changes to the receivable balances.
