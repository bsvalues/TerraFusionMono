Jeremy Wilson 34585 changes
The stored procedure wasn't designed is a fashion consistent with the original
way multi-line address tags were intended to be processed by the word merge classes.

Even more so, it appears the stored procedure was left half done since no alias name 
select statement was put in place to make nice with the word merge tree view.

So I decided to add the code to comply with that standard while I was in here adding stuff
for this ticket.  I also refactored some code where necessary to bring ARB letters more
into compliance with the way the Word Merge Letters Processing works.
