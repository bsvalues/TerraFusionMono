# Agent Resilience Features

## Overview

The County Audit Hub incorporates advanced resilience features to ensure system reliability and fault tolerance. These features allow the system to gracefully handle failures, prevent cascading errors, and automatically recover from issues without user intervention.

## Key Resilience Features

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures when services or agents experience issues. It works similarly to an electrical circuit breaker:

- **Closed State**: Normal operation, requests pass through
- **Open State**: After consecutive failures, the circuit "opens" and immediately fails requests without attempting to execute them
- **Half-Open State**: After a timeout period, the circuit allows a limited number of test requests to check if the issue is resolved

**Benefits**:
- Prevents overwhelming failing agents with requests
- Provides immediate failure feedback rather than waiting for timeouts
- Allows automatic recovery when services return to normal
- Reduces system-wide impact of localized failures

### 2. Self-Healing Capabilities

The enhanced agent manager monitors agent health and can automatically recover failed agents:

- Detects when agents fail or become unresponsive
- Automatically restarts failed agents with exponential backoff
- Tracks agent health metrics over time
- Provides detailed diagnostics for troubleshooting

**Benefits**:
- Reduces manual intervention requirements
- Minimizes downtime of critical services
- Provides gradual recovery with backoff strategies
- Maintains system functionality despite individual component failures

### 3. Enhanced Communication Bus

The enhanced communication bus provides resilient message passing between agents:

- Routes messages with circuit breaker protection
- Maintains metrics about message success/failure rates
- Handles agent communication errors gracefully
- Broadcasts system status changes to interested components

**Benefits**:
- Ensures reliable inter-agent communication
- Prevents message loss during system disruptions
- Provides visibility into communication health
- Enables fault isolation during problematic agent scenarios

### 4. Health Monitoring System

The health monitoring system continuously checks the status of agents and services:

- Performs periodic health checks on all agents
- Maintains historical health metrics
- Detects degraded performance before complete failures
- Triggers alerts when issues are detected

**Benefits**:
- Provides early warning of potential issues
- Enables proactive maintenance before user impact
- Creates detailed health reports for system administrators
- Facilitates capacity planning and performance optimization

## Implementation Details

### Circuit Breaker

The circuit breaker is implemented in `server/utils/circuit-breaker.ts` and contains:

- Configurable failure thresholds
- Adaptive state transitions
- Event-based notification system
- Comprehensive statistics tracking

### Circuit Breaker Registry

The circuit breaker registry in `server/utils/circuit-breaker-registry.ts` provides:

- Centralized management of circuit breakers
- On-demand creation of circuit breakers for new services
- Aggregated system-wide circuit status
- Configurable default settings

### Enhanced Agent Manager

The enhanced agent manager in `server/agents/enhanced-agent-manager.ts` handles:

- Agent lifecycle management
- Health check scheduling and monitoring
- Failure detection and recovery strategies
- Agent status reporting

### Resilience Integration

The resilience integration in `server/agents/resilience-integration.ts` combines all resilience features into a unified system:

- Initializes and configures all resilience components
- Provides a simplified interface for resilience features
- Manages system-wide health monitoring
- Facilitates graceful startup and shutdown

## Usage Examples

### Registering an Agent with Resilience Features

```typescript
// Create resilience integration
const resilience = new AgentResilienceIntegration(communicationBus);
await resilience.initialize();

// Register an agent with resilience features
resilience.registerAgent({
  agentId: 'data-validation:main',
  agentType: AgentType.DATA_VALIDATION,
  healthCheckIntervalMs: 60000, // Check health every minute
  retryDelayMs: 5000,          // Start with 5-second retry delay
  maxRetries: 3                // Allow up to 3 retry attempts
});

// Start all registered agents
await resilience.startAllAgents();
```

### Running a Resilience Diagnostic Test

```typescript
// Run a diagnostic test on an agent
const diagnosticResult = await runAgentResilienceDiagnostic(
  resilience,
  'data-validation:main'
);

console.log('Diagnostic results:', diagnosticResult);
```

### Shutting Down Resilience Features

```typescript
// Gracefully shut down all resilience features
await shutdownAgentResilience(resilience);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Circuit Breaker Stuck Open

If a circuit breaker remains open for an extended period:

1. Check logs for the specific error that triggered the circuit opening
2. Verify the service/agent is actually available and functioning
3. Use the circuit breaker registry to manually reset the breaker:
   ```typescript
   circuitBreakerRegistry.resetBreaker('agent-id');
   ```

### Agent Recovery Not Working

If an agent fails to recover automatically:

1. Check the agent health metrics to see failure patterns
2. Verify agent configuration is correct
3. Inspect logs for specific error messages
4. Consider increasing `maxRetries` or adjusting `retryDelayMs`

### Excessive Health Check Failures

If system shows frequent health check failures:

1. Check for network issues between components
2. Verify resource availability (CPU, memory, etc.)
3. Consider reducing system load or scaling resources
4. Adjust health check intervals to reduce overhead

## Conclusion

The resilience features in the County Audit Hub provide a robust foundation for reliable operation. By incorporating the circuit breaker pattern, self-healing capabilities, enhanced communication, and comprehensive health monitoring, the system can maintain functionality even when individual components experience issues.

These features significantly reduce the need for manual intervention, minimize downtime, and ensure a consistent user experience even under challenging conditions.
