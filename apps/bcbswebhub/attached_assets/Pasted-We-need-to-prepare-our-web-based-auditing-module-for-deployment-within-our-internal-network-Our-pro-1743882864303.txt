We need to prepare our web-based auditing module for deployment within our internal network. Our project comprises a React-based frontend and a Node.js/Express backend with Socket.IO for real-time updates, as well as robust authentication, logging, and data integration from our staging databases.

Here are the deployment steps:

1. Build Preparation:

Finalize production builds for the React frontend (using Create React App or Vite) and the Node.js backend.

Ensure that sensitive credentials are loaded from environment variables (using a .env file and python-dotenv for our sync service, and similar approaches for our Node.js backend).

2. Hosting Environment Setup:

Deploy the React build to an internal web server (e.g., Nginx) with HTTPS using an internal certificate.

Deploy the Node.js/Express API (with Socket.IO) on an internal server or container (using PM2 or Docker) and secure it with HTTPS.

Configure DNS so that our auditing module is accessible at a domain like 'audit.yourcounty.gov'.

3. CI/CD Pipeline:

Set up a CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions or an internal tool) that automates building, testing, packaging, and deploying both the frontend and backend.

The pipeline should use environment variables for sensitive data and run unit/integration tests before deployment.

4. End-to-End Testing:

Test the full solution by verifying that the React app loads from the internal domain, that API endpoints function correctly, and that real-time updates via Socket.IO work across multiple clients.

Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with a pilot group.

5. Rollout and Monitoring:

Once validated, roll out the solution to all users via internal deployment channels.

Set up logging and monitoring (using tools like Splunk, Sentry, or internal monitoring systems) to track application performance, error logs, and real-time events.

Plan for periodic security audits and performance reviews.

Please generate the necessary deployment configuration files, CI/CD workflow (example GitHub Actions YAML), and any deployment scripts required for both the frontend and backend. Ensure the instructions include using HTTPS, secure authentication (JWT or internal SSO), and real-time Socket.IO integration. The solution should be production-ready for internal deployment.

Provide the code and configuration files in a format that can be used directly to deploy the auditing module."
