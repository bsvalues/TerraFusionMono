Here’s a clear plan for folding **TerraFusionMono**—your full-platform monorepo—into the Plugin/Microservice Hybrid model, including the Nx scaffolding, plugin registration, Replit Agent bootstrap, and next steps.

---

## Summary

TerraFusionMono is a monorepo that houses all core services (gateway, mobile, dashboards, observability) alongside shared libraries and infrastructure‐as‐code within a unified Nx workspace citeturn1view0turn3view0. To integrate the SyncService (and any future plugins), we’ll:

1. **Scaffold an Nx project** under `apps/backend/syncservice` using the official Nx Python/Node plugins for consistent build/test/serve pipelines citeturn4search1turn4search2.
2. **Register** the SyncService as a `TerraFusionPlugin` so the Core Gateway auto-discovers its routes and jobs citeturn4search4turn4search0.
3. **Bootstrap** the Replit AI Agent with workspace config (`.replit`, `replit.nix`) and high-level prompts to generate the service code, manifest, and CI workflows citeturn4search5turn4search6.
4. **Deploy** via the existing Helm/Terraform pipeline, using Helm values for replica counts and resource quotas, all coordinated through Nx’s task graph citeturn4search8turn4search7.

## 1. TerraFusionMono Monorepo Overview

### 1.1 Repo Structure  
```
├── apps/
│   ├── core-gateway/        ← API gateway & plugin loader
│   ├── terrafield-mobile/   ← Mobile frontend & Edge agent runtime
│   └── …  
├── packages/                ← Shared libs (UI, SDKs, utils)
├── grafana/                 ← Dashboard definitions
├── prometheus/              ← Metrics config
├── server/                  ← Backend services  
├── shared/                  ← Common TypeScript/JS modules  
├── nx.json                  ← Nx workspace configuration  
├── workspace.json           ← Project definitions & targets  
├── .replit                  ← Replit run config  
└── replit.nix               ← Dev environment spec  
```  
This Nx workspace provides task orchestration, distributed caching, and code generators to keep builds fast and consistent citeturn4search3turn4search9.

### 1.2 Why Nx?  
Nx is a smart monorepo tool that optimizes CI performance, enforces architectural boundaries, and offers generators/executors out of the box for polyglot projects citeturn4search2turn4search8.

## 2. Integrating the SyncService Plugin

### 2.1 Scaffold the SyncService Project  
Run the Nx generator to create a new Python/Node app under `apps/backend`:
```bash
npx nx generate @nx/plugin:application \
  backend-sync --directory=apps/backend --framework=none
```
This adds a `project.json` with `build`, `serve`, and `test` targets you can customize citeturn4search1.

### 2.2 Implement TerraFusionPlugin Registration  
In `apps/backend/syncservice/src/plugin.ts`:
```ts
export const plugin: TerraFusionPlugin = {
  id: "sync-service",
  version: "0.1.0",
  mcpTools: [/* define sync endpoints as tools */],
  routes: (fastify) => {
    fastify.register(import("./routes").then(m => m.syncRoutes), { prefix: "/sync" });
  },
  jobs: [
    { name: "sync:incremental", executor: "nx run backend-sync:run_sync_job" },
  ],
};
```
The Core Gateway auto-loads this manifest and merges its OpenAPI into the unified docs citeturn4search0.

### 2.3 Add `manifest.yaml` & Resource Quotas  
Define process requirements in `apps/backend/syncservice/manifest.yaml`:
```yaml
id: sync-service
version: 0.1.0
permissions:
  network:
    - host: "pacs-db.local"
      port: 1433
resources:
  cpu: 500m
  memory: 512Mi
```
Helm will use these to set Pod `resources.requests` and `limits` citeturn4search7.

### 2.4 Update Helm & Terraform  
In `charts/syncservice/values.yaml`:
```yaml
replicaCount: 3
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "1"
    memory: "1Gi"
```
And in Terraform:
```hcl
resource "helm_release" "syncservice" {
  chart     = "charts/syncservice"
  namespace = "terrafusion"
  set {
    name  = "image.tag"
    value = var.syncservice_image_tag
  }
}
```
This leverages the existing monorepo pipeline for canary and full rollouts .

## 3. Replit AI Agent Bootstrap

### 3.1 `.replit` & `replit.nix`  
Ensure the root Repl supports Nx, Poetry, and Node:
```ini
# .replit
run = "nx serve apps/backend/syncservice"
language = "bash"
entrypoint = "bash start.sh"
```
```nix
# replit.nix
{ pkgs }: {
  deps = [ pkgs.nodejs pkgs.poetry pkgs.python39 ];
  devShell.shellHook = ''
    npm ci
    poetry install
  '';
}
```
This lets the Agent invoke `nx` commands directly citeturn4search5.

### 3.2 High-Level Agent Prompt  
```text
You are a Replit AI Agent. Scaffold a SyncService plugin under apps/backend/syncservice:
1. FastAPI endpoints: /sync/full, /sync/incremental, /health.
2. Conflict resolver, audit trails, NATS publisher.
3. Generate project.json with Nx targets.
4. Create manifest.yaml and update Helm/Terraform configs.
Commit files and open a PR.
```
Feed this to the Agent to bootstrap code generation and PR creation citeturn4search6.

---

## 4. Next Steps

- **Review & Merge PR** in the TerraFusionMono repo once CI passes.  
- **Scale & Monitor** via the Core Gateway’s health checks and NATS heartbeats.  
- **Iterate**: add GraphQL federation for audit lineage and embed SyncStatusPanel micro-frontend.  

With this integration, SyncService becomes a first-class TerraFusion plugin—isolated but uniformly managed, effortlessly auto-discovered, and scaled within your existing Nx-powered monorepo.
