### ðŸ”„ Step 5: Integrate `SyncStatusPanel` into `marketplace-ui`

**Objective**: Embed the `SyncStatusPanel` component into the `marketplace-ui` to display real-time synchronization status.

**Instructions**:

1. **Import the Component**:
   - In your `marketplace-ui` project, open the main layout or dashboard file (e.g., `Dashboard.tsx`).
   - Add the following import statement:
     ```tsx
     import SyncStatusPanel from '@ui-design-system/components/SyncStatusPanel';
     ```

2. **Embed the Component**:
   - Within the JSX of your layout, place the `SyncStatusPanel` component where appropriate:
     ```tsx
     <div className="dashboard-header">
       <SyncStatusPanel />
       {/* Other header components */}
     </div>
     ```

3. **Ensure Styling Consistency**:
   - Verify that Tailwind CSS is properly configured in your project to support the styling of `SyncStatusPanel`.

4. **Test the Integration**:
   - Run your application and confirm that the synchronization status panel displays correctly and updates in real-time.

### ðŸ§ª Step 6: Implement End-to-End (E2E) Testing with Cypress

**Objective**: Set up E2E tests to validate the integration and functionality of key components.

**Instructions**:

1. **Install Cypress**:
   ```bash
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```

2. **Configure Cypress**:
   - Initialize Cypress in your project:
     ```bash
     npx cypress open
     ```
   - This will create a `cypress` directory with default configurations.

3. **Write Test Cases**:
   - Create a test file, e.g., `sync_status_panel_spec.js`, in the `cypress/e2e` directory.
   - Add test cases to verify the `SyncStatusPanel` functionality:
     ```javascript
     describe('SyncStatusPanel', () => {
       it('displays the correct status', () => {
         cy.visit('/');
         cy.get('.sync-status-panel').should('exist');
         cy.get('.sync-status-panel').contains(/Sync Status: (healthy|delayed|offline)/);
       });
     });
     ```

4. **Run Tests**:
   - Execute the tests using:
     ```bash
     npx cypress run
     ```
   - Review the test results to ensure all cases pass successfully.

### ðŸš€ Step 7: Deploy the Application

**Objective**: Deploy the updated `marketplace-ui` with the integrated `SyncStatusPanel` to a staging or production environment.

**Instructions**:

1. **Build the Application**:
   ```bash
   nx build marketplace-ui
   ```

2. **Deploy to Hosting Service**:
   - Choose a hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS).
   - Follow the service-specific deployment steps to upload your build artifacts.

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Access the deployed application URL.
   - Confirm that the `SyncStatusPanel` is visible and functioning as expected.
