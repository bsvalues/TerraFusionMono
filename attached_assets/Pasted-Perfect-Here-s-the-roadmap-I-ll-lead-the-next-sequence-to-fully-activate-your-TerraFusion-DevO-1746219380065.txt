Perfect. Here's the roadmap. I'll lead the **next sequence** to fully activate your TerraFusion DevOps deployment and orchestration environment.

---

## 🎯 PHASE 1: Command Central Bootstrap  
> Deliver powerful one-command DevOps operations via a `Makefile`

---

### 📁 `/Makefile`

```makefile
# -- Global Variables --
REPO_NAME = ghcr.io/your-org/terrafusion-backend
IMAGE_TAG = latest

# -- Terraform Targets --
init:
	cd terraform && terraform init

plan:
	cd terraform && terraform plan

apply:
	cd terraform && terraform apply -auto-approve

destroy:
	cd terraform && terraform destroy -auto-approve

# -- Docker Targets --
build:
	docker build -f docker/backend.Dockerfile -t $(REPO_NAME):$(IMAGE_TAG) ./backend

push:
	docker push $(REPO_NAME):$(IMAGE_TAG)

# -- Helm Deploy --
helm-up:
	helm upgrade --install terrafusion-backend ./helm/terrafusion-backend --set image.tag=$(IMAGE_TAG)

# -- Full CI/CD Dev Deploy --
deploy-dev: build push helm-up

# -- Secret Rotation --
rotate-secrets:
	./scripts/rotate-secrets.sh

.PHONY: init plan apply destroy build push helm-up deploy-dev rotate-secrets
```

> ✅ This lets both humans and AI-Agents run the full infra stack cleanly.

## 🧠 PHASE 2: Agent Coordination Manifest

### 📄 `/agent-manifest.yaml`

```yaml
agents:
  - name: CurveTrainer
    version: "1.2.1"
    mode: autonomous
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"
    memory: persistent
    sensitivity: medium
    on_anomaly: suggest_correction

  - name: ScenarioAgent
    version: "0.9.7"
    mode: suggestive
    trigger_on: user_interest
    max_outputs: 3
    feedback_loop: true

  - name: BenchmarkGuard
    version: "2.0.0"
    mode: watchdog
    source:
      - rsmeans
      - corelogic
    alert_threshold: 5%
```

> This is **the source of truth for agent scheduling, logic tuning, and autonomy flags**. You'll mount this as a config map or volume into your swarm runners.

## 📊 PHASE 3: Agent Metrics Dashboard (Grafana)

### 📄 `/observability/grafana-dashboards/swarm-agent-activity.json`

This is a stubbed **Grafana dashboard JSON** to visualize:
- Agent run counts per day
- Agent anomalies detected
- User feedback per agent

Would you like me to now:
- Generate this JSON structure with PromQL placeholders?
- Write the parser/validator for `agent-manifest.yaml` (in Python or TypeScript)?
- Or scaffold `swarm/agent-runner.ts` to actually read and execute agents per manifest?

You're now in the final sprint. Your infrastructure has **a brain**, **a spine**, and **a voice**.

What gets deployed next?
