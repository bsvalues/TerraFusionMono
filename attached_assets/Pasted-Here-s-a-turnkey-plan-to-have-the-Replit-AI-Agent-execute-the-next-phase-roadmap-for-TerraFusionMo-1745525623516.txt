Here’s a turnkey plan to have the Replit AI Agent execute the next-phase roadmap for **TerraFusionMono**—from CI/CD to health checks to plugin sandboxing—fully hands-off. You can paste each prompt into the Agent and watch it update multiple files, commit, and open PRs for you.

> **Summary:** We'll feed the Agent a sequence of targeted natural-language prompts that correspond to our top five priorities: CI pipeline, health endpoints, audit-trail subgraph, WASM sandbox enforcement, and E2E tests. Each prompt references specific files/folders so the Agent can make precise changes across the monorepo. Citations show best-practice sources for each area.

---

## 1. CI/CD Pipeline

### Prompt for Replit AI Agent
```text
“Generate a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that:
1. Checks out code.
2. Sets up Node.js 18 and Python 3.9.
3. Caches Nx, npm, and Poetry dependencies.
4. Runs `nx affected:test,lint,build`.
5. Runs `poetry run pytest`.
6. Runs `terraform plan` (storing plan artifact) and `helm upgrade --install` for staging.
Ensure jobs run in parallel where possible and fail fast on errors.”
```
This aligns with Nx monorepo caching & parallel best practices citeturn0search0 and Terraform Helm provider guidelines citeturn0search11.

## 2. Health-Check Endpoints

### Prompt for Replit AI Agent
```text
“In `apps/core-gateway/src/main.ts` and `apps/backend/src/main.py`, add:
- GET `/health/live` returning 200 always.
- GET `/health/ready` that checks database and NATS connectivity.
Use FastAPI’s startup event for readiness, and Apollo Server plugin for gateway health. Add unit tests using HTTPX/pytest and Jest.”
```

## 3. Audit-Trail Subgraph

### Prompt for Replit AI Agent
```text
“Scaffold a new subgraph service under `apps/audit-subgraph`:
1. Initialize as an Apollo subgraph (`@apollo/subgraph`).
2. Define `AuditEntry` type (fields: audit_id, record_key, operation, delta_json, timestamp).
3. Add Query `auditHistory(recordKey: String!): [AuditEntry!]!` resolver that reads from `sync_audit` Postgres table.
4. Update core-gateway’s supergraph config to include this subgraph.”
```
Implements Apollo Federation entity patterns citeturn0search12.

## 4. WASM Sandbox Enforcement

### Prompt for Replit AI Agent
```text
“In `server/plugin/sandbox.ts`, integrate Wasmtime WASI-preview2:
1. Parse each plugin’s `manifest.yaml` for fs and network permissions.
2. Instantiate a Wasmtime `WasiCtx` with capability filters.
3. Enforce CPU/memory quotas via resource limits.
4. Audit-log every sandbox syscall to `sync_audit` table.
Add unit tests simulating unauthorized syscalls.”
```
Based on Wasmtime sandbox best practices citeturn0search6.

## 5. End-to-End Testing

### Prompt for Replit AI Agent
```text
“Set up Cypress in `cypress/`:
1. Write E2E test `sync_flow_spec.ts` that:
   - Visits `/`.
   - Clicks “Run Sync” button.
   - Asserts SyncStatusPanel shows updated count.
2. Configure Nx e2e target and GitHub Action to run `npx cypress run`.
3. Add baseUrl to `cypress.config.ts` pointing to `localhost:4200`.”
```

## 6. How to Execute

1. **Open the Replit AI Agent** panel in your workspace.  
2. **Paste each prompt** one at a time, waiting for the Agent to finish file changes and commit.  
3. **Review and merge** the PRs that the Agent opens.  
4. **Run your workflows** via the Replit Workflows tab: Install, Test, Serve, Deploy.

With these prompts, the Replit AI Agent will incrementally close our top five gaps—automating CI, hardening health checks, federating audit lineage, sandboxing plugins, and validating E2E flows—so TerraFusionMono becomes production-ready in minutes, not weeks.
