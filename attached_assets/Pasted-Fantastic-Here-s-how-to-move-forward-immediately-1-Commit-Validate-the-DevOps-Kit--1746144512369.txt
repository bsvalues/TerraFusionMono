Fantastic! Here’s how to move forward immediately:

---

## 1. Commit & Validate the DevOps Kit  
1. **Merge** the `devops/` folder into your `main` branch.  
2. **Ensure** your two Dockerfiles are present:  
   - `services/api-gateway/Dockerfile`  
   - `valuation-wizard/Dockerfile` (or root if that service lives at repo root)  
3. **Push** to GitHub and watch the Actions run: you should see:  
   - UI build for the wizard  
   - Docker images built & pushed  
   - Terraform apply deploying both Helm releases  

**Verify** in your Kubernetes cluster that:  
- A “api-gateway” Helm release is deployed, with a Service on port 8000.  
- A “valuation-wizard” Deployment+Service exists, serving on port 3000.  

---

## 2. Smoke-Test in Staging  
- **API Gateway**: `curl http://<gateway-host>:8000/health` → should return “OK”.  
- **Wizard UI**: Open `http://<wizard-host>` in browser → should load the stepper skeleton.  

Add a temporary health-check endpoint in the wizard service if needed.

---

## 3. Wire the Wizard into the Dashboard  
In your web app’s Dashboard component, add:

```jsx
import { ValuationWizard } from 'packages/ui/components/ValuationWizard';

function Dashboard() {
  // …
  return (
    <>
      {/* Quick Actions */}
      <button onClick={() => navigate('/wizard')}>Run Valuation Wizard</button>
      {/* Route */}
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/wizard" element={<ValuationWizard />} />
      </Routes>
    </>
  );
}
```

Deploy the updated web frontend and confirm you can click “Run Valuation Wizard” and see the stepper UI.

## 4. Next Sprint: Hook Up Data  
- **Step 1**: Implement `ParcelSelector` to call `GET /api/parcels?search=` and display results.  
- **Step 2**: Fetch comparables via `GET /api/assessor/comparables?parcelId=`.  
- **Step 3**: Allow weight adjustments in `WeightingEditor`, tracking state in the wizard.  
- **Step 4**: POST to `POST /api/assessor/value` in `ValuationRunner`.  
- **Step 5**: Render the returned `ValuationResult` in `ValuationReview`.

I can draft those API-integration snippets next—just say the word!
