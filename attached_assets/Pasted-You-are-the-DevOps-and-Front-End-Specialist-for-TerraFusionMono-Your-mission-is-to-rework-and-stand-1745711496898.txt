You are the DevOps-and-Front-End Specialist for TerraFusionMono. Your mission is to rework and standardize the entire front-end user workflow—transforming confusing, inconsistent screens into a cohesive, transparent, and high-performance interface.  

Context:  
- TerraFusionMono is an Nx monorepo with React/Tailwind front-end, React Router for navigation, and embedded Grafana dashboards.  
- Current UI is inconsistent: navigation patterns shift between modules, data sync has no progress indicators, and actions give no immediate feedback.  
- We need a design system, CI/CD gates, monitoring, and automated testing surrounding the front end.  

**Phase 1: Audit & Plan**  
1. Generate a complete inventory of existing front-end pages, components, and CSS patterns.  
2. Map current user flows (data collection → sync → analysis → report). Identify pain points.  
3. Produce wireflows for the new unified flow (field inspector, analyst, admin personas).  

**Phase 2: Design System & Component Library**  
1. Scaffold a Storybook + Tailwind + shadcn/ui design system.  
2. Define tokens: colors, spacing, typography, and iconography.  
3. Create core components: Button, Navbar, Sidebar, Modal, Notification, ProgressBar.  
4. Publish the component library within Nx as `@terrafusion/ui`.  

**Phase 3: Implementation & CI/CD**  
1. Refactor pages to use `@terrafusion/ui` components; remove ad-hoc CSS.  
2. Integrate React state machines (XState) to visualize data-sync workflows with step indicators.  
3. Update GitHub Actions pipeline:  
   - Stage 1: lint (ESLint, TailwindCSS linter)  
   - Stage 2: unit tests (Jest)  
   - Stage 3: storybook build and accessibility checks (axe)  
   - Stage 4: e2e tests (Cypress) against preview environment  
   - Stage 5: bundle-size and performance budget check (Lighthouse)  
   - Stage 6: deploy to staging/production with semantic versioning and feature flags.  

**Phase 4: Observability & SLOs**  
1. Hook Web Vitals into Prometheus/Grafana with clear dashboards and alerting rules.  
2. Integrate Sentry for front-end error tracking.  
3. Define SLIs (load time, error rate) and SLOs; configure auto-rollback on breach.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- All critical user flows (login, data sync, report generation) pass automated e2e tests.  
- Every PR spins up an ephemeral preview with Storybook, Cypress, and Lighthouse reports.  
- Front-end bundle ≤ 200 KB gzipped and 95th-percentile FCP < 1.5 s.  
- Design system published and adopted by all pages (zero raw CSS drift).  
- Grafana dashboards display Web Vitals by page type and network; alerts fire on SLO breaches.  

Begin by generating the audit report (Phase 1) and share the flow diagrams. Then proceed through each phase in order, requesting your review at the end of each phase.
